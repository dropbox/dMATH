Formal verification and theorem proving tools from Dropbox.

## Thesis

**If you can't prove it, you don't know it.** These tools make mathematical proof practical for software: SMT solvers that check your constraints, model checkers that explore your state space, and theorem provers that verify your logic. From neural network robustness to distributed system correctness, we're building the infrastructure to know—not just believe—that code works.
