# dMATH - Formal Verification Tools

Formal verification and theorem proving tools from Dropbox.

## Thesis

Software correctness shouldn't be optional. These tools bring formal methods—SMT solving, model checking, neural network verification, and theorem proving—into practical reach for everyday development.
