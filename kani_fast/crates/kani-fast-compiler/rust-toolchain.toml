# Kani Fast Compiler requires nightly Rust with rustc internal APIs
#
# NOTE: We use nightly-2025-11-20 for newer rustc API features (RuntimeChecks, etc).
# The upstream Kani 0.66.0 release ships libkani built with nightly-2025-11-05, so
# test_driver.sh prefers a locally rebuilt copy at ~/.kani/kani-0.66.0-fast/lib that
# matches this toolchain and falls back to the release library if missing.
#
# See: https://github.com/model-checking/kani/blob/main/rust-toolchain.toml
#
# To install:
#   rustup install nightly-2025-11-20
#   rustup component add --toolchain nightly-2025-11-20 rustc-dev rust-src
