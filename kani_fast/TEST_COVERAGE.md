# Kani Fast Test Coverage

This file documents the comprehensive test coverage for the kani-fast-driver CHC verification engine.

> **Note:** Test counts are computed dynamically. Run `scripts/summarize_driver_tests.sh` to get
> current counts. The numbers below may become stale as tests are added/modified.

## Test Categories

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| PASS | 337 | Tests that verify correctly (static definitions) |
| Expected failure | 303 | Known limitations that correctly fail (13 skipped in fast mode) |
| Soundness bugs | 32 | Tracked soundness bugs (in unsound.sh) |
| Skipped (fast mode) | ~25 | Medium/slow tests skipped unless FULL or BENCHMARK is set |
| **Total defined** | 672 | All driver tests |

## Run Tests

```bash
# Driver tests (end-to-end CHC verification)
cd crates/kani-fast-compiler && ./test_driver.sh
scripts/summarize_driver_tests.sh  # Get current pass/fail/soundness counts

# Unit tests
cargo test --workspace                       # 3568 pass (workspace crates, 2026-01-06)
cd crates/kani-fast-compiler && cargo test   # 81 tests (compiler crate, separate)
```

`scripts/summarize_driver_tests.sh` reports the static definitions (currently 337 pass, 303 expected-fail, 32 soundness). The default fast run of `./test_driver.sh` skips ~25 medium/slow cases, so expect ~328 pass, ~287 expected-fail, 25 skipped, 32 soundness in its summary. Use the script to verify counts after editing `crates/kani-fast-compiler/tests/*.sh`.
