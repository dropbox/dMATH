00. check NoCycles                 0    1/1     SAT
01. run   run$2                    0    1/1     SAT

INTERPRETATION:
- check NoCycles: SAT = Counterexample found = Assertion VIOLATED
  - Counterexample: skolem $NoCycles_n = {Node$0}
  - This node reaches itself through edges (cycle exists)
- run run$2: SAT = Instance found

Counterexample from NoCycles-solution-0.md:
  skolem $NoCycles_n = {Node$0}

This means Node$0 is in its own transitive closure (Node$0 -> Node$0)
