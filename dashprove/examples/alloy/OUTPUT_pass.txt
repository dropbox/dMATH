INTERPRETATION:
- check InitialNotFinal: UNSAT = No counterexample found = Assertion HOLDS
- run run$2: SAT = Instance found = Model is satisfiable

For check commands:
- UNSAT = Assertion holds (no counterexample)
- SAT = Assertion violated (counterexample found)

For run commands:
- SAT = Instance found
- UNSAT = No instance exists
