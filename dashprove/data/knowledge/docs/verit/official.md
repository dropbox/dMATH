An open, trustable and efficient SMT-solver
[ ** DOWNLOAD veriT ][7]

## WHAT IS veriT?

veriT is a SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver. It is open-source, proof-producing, and
complete for quantifier-free formulas with uninterpreted functions and linear arithmetic on real
numbers and integers. It also offers good support for quantifiers. The input format is the [SMT-LIB
2.0][8] language and [DIMACS][9].

veriT is open-source and distributed under the [BSD license][10].

veriT has proof-production capabilities that may be used or checked by external tools. At the [SMT
competition][11] veriT's performance is competitive for some theories.

The project is under active development, and newcomers are most welcome! Just [contact us][12].

Past developers have helped a lot:

* Daniel El Ouraoui developed support for higher-order logic within quantifier instantiation and
  worked on instantiation heuristics including some based on machine learning.
* Pablo Federico Dobal developed the SMTpp tool and contributed to the testing infrastructure and
  the arithmetic reasoning module.
* Richard Bonichon and Cláudia Tavares developed the SMTpp tool.
* Diego Caminha Barbosa de Oliveira developed the arithmetic reasoning module and contributed to the
  combination framework in the theory reasoning engine.
* Thomas Bouton contributed to the QA infrastructure and the integration of the SAT solver with the
  theory reasoning engine.

Special thanks to:

* [Jasmin Blanchette][101] funded some of the veriT development within the [Matryoshka][102] project
  and provided countless invaluable advice and suggestions.
* [Mathias Fleury][103] implemented the reconstruction of veriT's proofs in Isabelle/HOl. During
  this he helped to improve the proof output.
* [Chantal Keller][104] implemented SMTCoq.

In case you want to participate in the development of a SMT-solver, you may want to join the team of
developers of veriT.

If you are interested in a PhD or post-doctoral position to work on the development and applications
of veriT, either at [LORIA][105] (Nancy, France) or [ULiège][106] (Liège, Belgium), please [contact
us][107] in advance so that we look for funding for your stay.

## Tools

### We use several tools to develop veriT or integrate veriT.

#### SMT-LIB

The [SMT-LIB][108] standard provides a common input/output language for SMT solvers. veriT follows
the SMT-LIB standard for the features it supports. The language is based on s-expressions and mostly
designed to be easy to parse. A multi-sorted first order logic serves as the semantic. We are also
involved in the development of the standard.

The SMT-LIB initiative also maintains a big collection of SMT-LIB [benchmarks][109]. Those
benchmarks provide an invaluable resource for the development and testing of veriT. We strongly
encourage users of SMT solvers to submit benchmarks to the SMT-LIB project.

#### Isabelle/HOL: veriT as tactic and Sledgehammer backend

[Isabelle/HOL][110] can call veriT to discharge proof goals. This is implemented as part of the
*smt* tactic and complements the existing support for the SMT solver Z3. The method reconstructs the
proofs generated by veriT inside the trusted kernel of Isabelle/HOL.

Furthermore, veriT is available as a backend to the [Sledgehammer][111] tool to find proofs and it
will also suggest the veriT powered *smt* method to the user as a command to insert into their proof
script.

#### GridTPT

The GridTPT platform has been used to support the development of the SMT solver veriT for several
years. Since programming provers is a complex task, a good testing platform can contribute in
detecting bugs early and helping development. GridTPT's features are fairly standard, but it allows
to easily distribute the task in a cluster for extensive tests to be completed quickly.

GridTPT is neither stable nor easy to use, but if you are looking for a testing platform for your
prover or solver, contact us and we will help you to install, configure and use the solver. This
will also help us to improve the tool and hopefully eventually distribute a adaptable tool to the
community. The code is BSD and written mostly in Python.

#### SAT solver within Matlab and Octave

Interface between the veriT SAT solver and either [Matlab][112] or [Octave][113]. The SAT problem
can be modeled using Matlab matrices. The current implementation allows to either use dense or
sparse matrices. It has already been used successfully under Windows 7 64 bits and Ubuntu 13.10 64
bits. It is intended to be used by industrial as well as academic communities. The code is released
under the BSD license.

Different packages for different operating systems and architectures are available:

* [package][114] for Windows 7 64 bits with Matlab
* [package][115] for Windows 7 32 bits with Matlab
* [package][116] for Linux 64 bits with Matlab
* [package][117] for Linux 64 bits with Octave

## External software

### veriT relies on third-party software using them either as libraries or as stand-alone
### applications. veriT is also used or integrated with other software.

#### GNU MP (is used by veriT)

The [GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library][118] is used to represent and manipulate numerical
value. It is distributed under the GNU LGPL.

#### Rodin (integrates veriT)

Rodin is an Eclipse-based development environment for Event-B. The [SMT plug-in for Rodin][119]
allows to use SMT-solvers to discharge proof obligations. It is still under development.

#### REDUCE (can be used by veriT)

[REDUCE][120] is a computer algebra system often used as an algebraic calculator for problems that
are possible to do by hand. Some versions of veriT use Reduce.

#### E (was used by veriT)

The [E equational theorem prover][121] is a first-order logic theorem prover based on the
superposition calculus. It was used by veriT as a standalone application. It is released under the
GNU GPL.

#### CRefine (was used by veriT)

[CRefine][122] is an editor that supports the formal development of concurrent object-oriented
software in [Circus][123] by implementing a refinement calculus.

#### Bliss (was used by veriT)

[Bliss][124] is a backtracking algorithm for computing automorphism groups and canonical forms of
graphs, based on individualization and refinement.

#### Saucy (was used by veriT)

[Saucy][125] is the implementation of a symmetry-discovery algorithm.

#### PermLib (was used by veriT)

[PermLib][126] is a C++ library for permutation computations.

#### MiniSat (was used by veriT)

In early releases, veriT used the SAT-solver [MiniSat][127] to represent and manipulate the boolean
structure of the formulas.
