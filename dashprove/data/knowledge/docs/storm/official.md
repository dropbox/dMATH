### Description

Storm is a tool for the analysis of systems involving random or probabilistic phenomena. Given an
input model and a quantitative specification, it can determine whether the input model conforms to
the specification. It has been designed with performance and modularity in mind.
[Getting started][31]

### Modeling formalisms

Storm is built around discrete- and continuous-time Markov models:

* Discrete-time Markov Chains
* Markov Decision Processes
* Continuous-time Markov Chains
* Markov Automata
* Parametric Markov Models
* Partially Observable Markov Models

### Input languages

Storm supports several types of input:

* PRISM
* JANI
* GSPNs
* DFTs
* explicit
[Read more][33]

### Properties

Supported model checking queries include

* Reachability and Reach-Avoid Probabilities
* PCTL, CSL, and LTL Specifications
* Expected Accumulated Rewards
* Long-run Average Rewards
* Conditional Probabilities
* Multi-objective Analysis
