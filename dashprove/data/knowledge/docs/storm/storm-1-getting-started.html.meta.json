  "content": "## 1. Obtain Storm\n\nTo be able to run Storm, you need to obtain it and run it on your system.\nCurrently, you can choose one of the following options:\n\n* Build Storm [from source][1] on macOS or Linux\n* Install Storm via a supported package manager\n  \n  * [Homebrew][2] on macOS\n  * [AUR][3] on Arch Linux\n* Use a [Docker container][4] on macOS, Linux or Windows\n* Use a [virtual machine][5] on macOS, Linux or Windows\n\n## 2. Prepare a model checking query\n\nAfter you have obtained Storm, you need to make sure that your input model has\nthe right form. That is, on a fundamental level, you need to ensure that your\ninput model falls into one of the [model types][6] supported by Storm.\n\nIf your model indeed does, then the next thing is to have the model available in\nan [input language][7] of Storm. If you don’t have such a model yet, you need to\nfirst model the system you are interested in or transcribe it from a different\ninput format.\n\nHowever, the input model is only “half” of the input you need to provide, the\nother “half” being the property you want to verify. Please consult our [guide to\nproperties][8] for details on how to specify them.\n\nAn extensive list of example models and properties is available at the\n[Quantitative Verification Benchmark Set][9].\n\n## 3. Run Storm\n\nFinally, if both the input model as well as the property are captured in an\nappropriate format, then you are ready to run Storm!\n\nOur [guide][10] illustrates how you can do so. Since the calls (and even the\nbinaries) you need to invoke depend on the input language for each of the input\nlanguages, the guide shows how to run Storm depending on the input you have.\n\n[1]: documentation/obtain-storm/build.html\n[2]: documentation/obtain-storm/homebrew.html\n[3]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/stormchecker\n[4]: documentation/obtain-storm/docker.html\n[5]: documentation/obtain-storm/vm.html\n[6]: documentation/background/models.html\n[7]: documentation/background/languages.html\n[8]: documentation/background/properties.html\n[9]: https://qcomp.org/benchmarks\n[10]: documentation/usage/running-storm.html\n",
