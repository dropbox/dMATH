## Implement Deep Static Code Analysis

#### Find Vulnerabilities Others Miss

CodeSonar is a static code analysis solution that helps you find and understand quality and
[security][71] defects in your [source code][72] or binaries. CodeSonar makes it easy to integrate
SAST into your development process with support for over 100 compilers and compiler versions,
numerous integrations to popular development tools and IDEs, and whole-program analysis that finds
issues other tools miss.

## Bring Security into DevSecOps

#### At Speed and [Scale][73]

CodeSonar was doing DevSecOps before it was cool. Industries and companies are rapidly undergoing a
digital transformation. Techniques like DevSecOps help companies respond to this challenge by
releasing solutions to market faster and with fewer defects. Static code analysis is a fundamental
component of DevSecOps and CodeSonar is here to help.
