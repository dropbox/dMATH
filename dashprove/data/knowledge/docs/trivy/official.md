"I love how Trivy democratized dependency scanning to the masses as a free and extremely easy to use
tool, with also a permissive license. This used to be a gated community with predatory security
vendors charging premium, and they were not half as good as Trivy."

[@dynaptik][21]
"Trivy easily for what it brings to the table (secret scanning, vuln scan, license check) and little
effort required. Bang for the buck it's pretty amazing"
