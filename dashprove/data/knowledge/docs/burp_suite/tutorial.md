## Up-to-the-minute learning resources

The Web Security Academy is a free online training center for web application security. It includes
content from PortSwigger's in-house research team, experienced academics, and our Chief Swig Dafydd
Stuttard - author of [The Web Application Hacker's Handbook][77].

Unlike a textbook, the Academy is constantly updated. It also includes interactive labs where you
can put what you learn to the test. If you want to improve your knowledge of hacking, or you'd like
to become a bug bounty hunter or pentester, you're in the right place.

## Satisfy your curiosity - safely and legally

We make Burp Suite - the leading software for web security testing. And we love our users (because
they're the people who make Burp what it is). That's why we created the Web Security Academy. It's
also why the Academy is 100% free.

The Web Security Academy exists to help anyone who wants to learn about web security in a safe and
legal manner. You can access everything (for free) and track your progress by [creating an
account][78]. Please see the sidebar for more information.

## Hack like the pros do

Web security and ethical hacking are lucrative careers to get into, but they're often seen as dark
and mysterious arts. The Web Security Academy smashes that stereotype. We make the latest
application security knowledge available to everyone.

Some of our interactive labs will, by their nature, require you to use tools to solve them. But fear
not. If you don't have access to Burp Suite Professional, then Burp Suite Community Edition allows
you to experiment for free. [Download Burp Suite here][79].

## Web security training built for humans, not robots

Let's face it, some of the online web application training out there can be a bit dull. And isn't
hacking supposed to be fun? We certainly think so. That's why we've taken a fully interactive
approach when it comes to the design of our web security training.

While each topic in the Academy is fully explained in text, many also include video content to
summarize key points. Then there are the interactive labs - realistic puzzles designed to test your
skills as a hacker. These transfer directly over into real-life cybersecurity situations.

[Cool swag]

## Track your progress, win cool swag

Although we designed the labs to be fun, that doesn't necessarily mean they're easy (because where
would be the fun in that, right?). We also love a bit of competition here at the Web Security
Academy - and that's how we came up with the idea for the [Hall of Fame][80].

Every time we release a new lab, we'll announce it on [Twitter][81]. The first Web Security Academy
users to solve the lab will win Burp Suite swag - as well as getting their name in the Hall of Fame
for all to see. Of course, you can remain anonymous if you prefer.
