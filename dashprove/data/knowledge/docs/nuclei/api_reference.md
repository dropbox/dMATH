Write and test Nuclei templates directly in your browser using our [template editor][1]. The editor
supports AI-assisted template generation, real-time validation, and immediate scanning against your
targets. Need automation? Check out our [template generation API][2].

## What are Nuclei Templates?

Nuclei templates are the cornerstone of the Nuclei scanning engine. Nuclei templates enable precise
and rapid scanning across various protocols like TCP, DNS, HTTP, and more. They are designed to send
targeted requests based on specific vulnerability checks, ensuring low-to-zero false positives and
efficient scanning over large networks.

## [​][4]
## YAML

Nuclei templates are based on the concepts of `YAML` based template files that define how the
requests will be sent and processed. This allows easy extensibility capabilities to nuclei. The
templates are written in `YAML` which specifies a simple human-readable format to quickly define the
execution process.

## Universal Language for Vulnerabilities

Nuclei Templates offer a streamlined way to identify and communicate vulnerabilities, combining
essential details like severity ratings and detection methods. This open-source, community-developed
tool accelerates threat response and is widely recognized in the cybersecurity world.
