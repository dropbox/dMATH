# [Welcome to cargo-mutants][1]

cargo-mutants is a mutation testing tool for Rust. It helps you improve your program’s quality by
finding places where bugs can be inserted without causing any tests to fail.

**The goal of cargo-mutants is to be *easy* to run on any Rust source tree, and to tell you
something *interesting* about areas where bugs might be lurking or the tests might be
insufficient.** ([More about these goals][2].)

To get started:

1. [Install cargo-mutants][3].
2. [Run `cargo mutants`][4] in your Rust source tree.
