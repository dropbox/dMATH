# Improve fairness
# of AI systems

### Fairlearn is an open-source, community-driven project to help data scientists improve fairness
### of AI systems.

Learn about AI fairness from our guides and use cases. Assess and mitigate fairness issues using our
Python toolkit. Join our community and contribute metrics, algorithms, and other resources.

FAIRNESS IS SOCIOTECHNICAL

Fairness of AI systems is about more than simply running lines of code. In each use case, both
societal and technical aspects shape who might be harmed by AI systems and how. There are many
complex sources of unfairness and a variety of societal and technical processes for mitigation, not
just the mitigation algorithms in our library.

Throughout this website, you can find resources on how to think about fairness as sociotechnical,
and how to use Fairlearn's metrics and algorithms while considering the AI system's broader societal
context.

USE CASE | CREDIT-CARD LOANS

## Assessment and mitigation of fairness issues in credit-card default models

When making a decision to approve or decline a loan, financial services organizations use a variety
of models, including a model that predicts the applicant's probability of default. These predictions
are sometimes used to automatically reject or accept an application, directly impacting both the
applicant and the organization.

In this scenario, fairness-related harms may arise when the model makes more mistakes for some
groups of applicants compared to others. We use Fairlearn to assess how different groups, defined in
terms of their sex, are affected and how the observed disparities may be mitigated.
