# MIRAI

MIRAI is an abstract interpreter for the [Rust][1] compiler's [mid-level intermediate
representation][2] (MIR).

It started out as a Facebook project, but became orphaned when the sponsoring organization was
disbanded.

Ongoing work to keep the project alive now happens at [https://github.com/endorlabs/MIRAI][3].
