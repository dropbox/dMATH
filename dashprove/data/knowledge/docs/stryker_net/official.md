* Stryker.NET
* Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Stryker for .NET. Also known as Stryker.NET or stryker-net.

# Stryker.NET

Stryker.NET offers you mutation testing for your .NET Core and .NET Framework projects. It allows
you to test your tests by temporarily inserting bugs. Stryker.NET is installed using NuGet.

# Background

Stryker.NET joined the stryker family in 2018 based on the idea that the .NET landscape missed a
good mutation testing tool that other languages have had for years. We believe mutation testing
should be a bigger part of the .NET community.
