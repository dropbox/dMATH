# About NeMo Guardrails[#][1]

NeMo Guardrails enables developers building LLM-based applications to easily add **programmable
guardrails** between the application code and the LLM.

[Programmable Guardrails]

Key benefits of adding *programmable guardrails* include:

* **Building Trustworthy, Safe, and Secure LLM-based Applications:** you can define rails to guide
  and safeguard conversations; you can choose to define the behavior of your LLM-based application
  on specific topics and prevent it from engaging in discussions on unwanted topics.
* **Connecting models, chains, and other services securely:** you can connect an LLM to other
  services (a.k.a. tools) seamlessly and securely.
* **Controllable dialog**: you can steer the LLM to follow pre-defined conversational paths,
  allowing you to design the interaction following conversation design best practices and enforce
  standard operating procedures (e.g., authentication, support).
