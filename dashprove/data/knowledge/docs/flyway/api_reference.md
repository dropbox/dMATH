# Flyway within your organization and to act accordingly if you need to. This will help reduce silos
# by allowing your whole team to view a history of database deployments without the need to connect
# to multiple environments to see the latest state of your databases, especially helpful for locked

### Flyway Command Line & API

The Flyway command line and API are included as part of your Flyway Desktop installer.

Flyway has the following commands at its disposal: [Migrate][8] , [Clean][9] , [Info][10] ,
[Validate][11] , [Undo][12] , [Baseline][13], [Repair][14], [Check][15] and [Snapshot][16] .

Migrations can be written in [SQL ][17](native database-specific syntax such as PL/SQL and T-SQL is
supported) or [Java ][18](for advanced data transformations or dealing with LOBs).

If you are on the JVM, we recommend using the [Java API][19] for migrating the database on
application startup. Alternatively, you can also use the [Maven plugin][20] or [Gradle Plugin][21].
There are [community plugins][22] available for Spring Boot, Dropwizard, Grails, Play, SBT, Ant,
Griffon, Grunt, Ninja and more!

You can find out about [Databases the CLI supports][23] in the documents and the list includes
[Oracle][24], [SQL Server][25], [MySQL][26] (plus variants), [PostgreSQL][27] (and many variants) as
well as NoSQL databases like [MongoDB][28] and [Cassandra][29].

If you are looking for whether specific databases have Foundational or Advanced support then see
[Supported Databases and Versions][30]
