# The mCRL2 toolset[][2]

[[Modeling and analysis of communicating systems (book)] ][3]

mCRL2 is a formal specification language with an associated toolset. The toolset can be used for
modelling, validation and verification of concurrent systems and protocols. It can be run on
Windows, Linux, Apple MacOS and FreeBSD.

The toolset supports a collection of tools for linearisation, simulation, state-space exploration
and generation and tools to optimise and analyse specifications. Moreover, state spaces can be
manipulated, visualised and analysed.

The mCRL2 toolset is developed at the department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the
[Technische Universiteit Eindhoven][4], in collaboration with the [University of Twente][5].

Note

The latest release, mCRL2 202507.0, is now available from the [Download mCRL2][6] page. See the
[changelog][7] for a detailed list of changes.

Note

The Coursera lectures are now freely available on Youtube, divided in four parts. It is intended
that the full course including exercises will soon be available on openlearnity.com.

* [Automata and behavioural equivalences][8].
* [Model process behaviour][9].
* [Requirements by modal formulas][10].
* [Modelling software, protocols, and other behaviour][11].

[[Understanding Behaviour of Distributed Systems using mCRL2 (book)] ][13]

A new introductory book appeared, describing the mCRL2 specification language, the modal mu-calculus
and the extensive toolset around these. The book is full of examples, varying from games to
distributed algorithms. It is shown how such games can be solved, and how the (in)correctness of
such algorithms can be understood.

[[TACAS artefact evaluation badge] ][14]

A tool paper explaining the latest developments in mCRL2 was published in TACAS2019. The new
features include counterexamples, probabilistic processes and efficient algorithms for several types
of behavioural relations. As part of the review process, mCRL2 was tested and accepted by the TACAS
artefact evaluation committee. The paper is [available][15] under open access.

Note

On Coursera four consecutive courses consisting of approximately 60 lectures provide an introduction
into the theory and practical use of the mCRL2 toolset. It is based on the book ‘Modeling and
Analysis of Communicating Systems’ shown above. Unfortunately, these are now behind a pay wall. The
courses are:

* [Automata and behavioural equivalences][16].
* [Model process behaviour][17].
* [Requirements by modal formulas][18].
* [Modelling software, protocols, and other behaviour][19].

The slides used to make these courses are available by contacting [J.F.Groote@tue.nl][20]. They can
also be downloaded from [MIT Press][21].

[[Verum is the industry leader in reliable software design.] ][22]

mCRL2 is used by the company [Verum][23] as their verification engine. Verum provides model based
software development environments for the languages ASD and Dezyne that allow to program proven
correct embedded software with much less effort than “classical” programming. As it stands Verum is
the industry leader in reliable software design.
