### Fast

Built from the ground up to support gradual typing and deliver responsive incremental checks.
Performant on large codebases with millions of lines of Python.

### Integrated

Designed to help improve code quality and development speed by flagging type errors interactively in
your terminal or live in your favorite editor.

### Fully Featured

Follows the typing standards introduced in [PEPs 484][1], [526][2], [612][3], and is being actively
developed and constantly improved.

### Built For Security

Pyre ships with [Pysa][4], a security focused static analysis tool we've built to reason about data
flows in Python applications at scale.
