# DNNV[#][1]

DNNV is a framework for verifying deep neural networks (DNN). DNN verification takes in a neural
network, and a property over that network, and checks whether the property is true or false. DNNV
standardizes the network and property input formats to enable multiple verification tools to run on
a single network and property. This facilitates both verifier comparison, and artifact re-use.
