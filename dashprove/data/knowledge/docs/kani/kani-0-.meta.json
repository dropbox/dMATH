  "content": "# [Getting started][1]\n\nKani is an open-source verification tool that uses [model checking][2] to\nanalyze Rust programs. Kani is useful for checking both safety and correctness\nof Rust code.\n\n* *Safety*: Kani automatically checks for many kinds of [undefined behavior][3].\n  This makes it particularly useful for verifying unsafe code blocks in Rust,\n  where the \"[unsafe superpowers][4]\" are unchecked by the compiler.\n* *Correctness*: Kani automatically checks panics (e.g. `unwrap()` on `None`),\n  arithmetic overflows, and custom correctness properties, either in the form of\n  assertions (`assert!(...)`) or [function contracts][5].\n\nSince Kani uses model checking, Kani will either prove the property, disprove\nthe property (with a counterexample), or may run out of resources.\n\nKani uses proof harnesses to analyze programs. Proof harnesses are similar to\ntest harnesses, especially property-based test harnesses.\n\n## [Project Status][6]\n\nKani is currently under active development. Releases are published [here][7].\nMajor changes to Kani are documented in the [RFC Book][8]. We also publish\nupdates on Kani use cases and features on our [blog][9].\n\nThere is support for a fair amount of Rust language features, but not all (e.g.,\nconcurrency). Please see [Limitations][10] for a detailed list of supported\nfeatures.\n\nKani releases every month. As part of every release, Kani will synchronize with\na recent nightly release of Rust, and so is generally up-to-date with the latest\nRust language features.\n\nIf you encounter issues when using Kani, we encourage you to [report them to\nus][11].\n\n[1]: #getting-started\n[2]: ./tool-comparison.html\n[3]: ./undefined-behaviour.html\n[4]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#unsafe-super\npowers\n[5]: https://model-checking.github.io/kani/reference/experimental/contracts.html\n[6]: #project-status\n[7]: https://github.com/model-checking/kani/releases\n[8]: https://model-checking.github.io/kani/rfc\n[9]: https://model-checking.github.io/kani-verifier-blog/\n[10]: ./limitations.html\n[11]: https://github.com/model-checking/kani/issues/new/choose\n",
