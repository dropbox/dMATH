# A Crash Course in Idris 2[#][1]

This is a crash course in Idris 2 (sort of a tutorial, but rather less gentle I’m afraid!). It
provides a brief introduction to programming in the Idris Language. It covers the core language
features, assuming some experience with an existing functional programming language such as Haskell
or OCaml.

This has been revised and updated from the Idris 1 tutorial. For details of changes since Idris 1,
see [Changes since Idris 1][2].
