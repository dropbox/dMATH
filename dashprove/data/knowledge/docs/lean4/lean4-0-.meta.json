  "content": "# Learn Lean\n\nLean is a functional programming language and theorem prover built for\nformalizing math and for formal verification, but is flexible enough for general\ncoding. If you’re a beginner, we recommend the Natural Number Game. If you feel\nready to dive deeper, there are great textbooks, tutorials and interactive games\nto be found on this page.\n\n[API Reference][1][Install][2][Core Docs][3]\n\n## Core documentation\n\n[\n\n**Functional Programming in Lean (FPIL)** is the main resource for programmers\nwho want to learn Lean. It assumes a background in programming, but no prior\nknowledge of functional programming is needed.\n\nREAD NOW\n][4][\n\n**Theorem Proving in Lean (TPIL)** is designed to teach you to develop and\nverify proofs in Lean and covers dependent type theory, automated proof methods,\nand Lean-specific features for interactive theorem proving.\n\nREAD NOW\n][5][\n\n**Mathematics in Lean (MIL)** is the main resource for mathematicians who want\nto learn mathematical formalization through interactive, tactic-based theorem\nproving using Lean's Mathlib library.\n\nREAD NOW\n][6][\n\n**The Lean Language Reference** is a comprehensive, precise description of Lean:\na reference work in which all aspects of Lean are clearly specified, and\ndemonstrated through succinct examples.\n\nREAD NOW\n][7]\n\n## Further reading\n\n[\n\n**Mathlib API Reference** Includes reference information for Lean core, the Lean\nstandard library, Mathlib, and other critical Lean packages.\n\nREAD NOW\n][8][\n\n**The Hitchhiker's Guide to Logical Verification** Originally designed as a\ncompanion text for a graduate-level course on interactive theorem proving at\nVrije Universiteit Amsterdam.\n\nREAD NOW\n][9][\n\n**Logic and Proof** A textbook teaching the basics of classical logic, such as\npropositional logic, first order logic, natural deduction and axiomatic\nreasoning, using Lean.\n\nREAD NOW\n][10][\n\n**The Mechanics of Proof** Originally written as a companion text to the course\nMath2001 at Fordham University, it teaches the basics of mathematical reasoning\nto students of mathematics using Lean.\n\nREAD NOW\n][11]\n\n## Interactive Games and Tutorials\n\n[\n\n**The Natural Number Game** A gamified introduction to mathematical proof that\nintroduces Lean 4 concepts through a purpose-built Lean 4 dialect.\n\nPLAY NOW\n][12][\n\n**The Lean Game Server** A collection of games similar to the Natural Number\nGame.\n\nPLAY NOW\n][13]\n\n## Tools for working with Lean\n\n[\n\n**Lean 4 VS Code Extension Manual** Describes how to interact with Lean 4 using\nthe VS Code extension.\n\nREAD NOW\n][14][\n\n**Semantic Highlighting** Configuring Lean's semantic highlighing (enabled in\nVSCode by selecting \"Editor > Semantic Highlighting\"\n\nREAD NOW\n][15][\n\n**LaTeX** Best practices for highlighting Lean code in LaTeX documents\n\nREAD NOW\n][16]\n\n## Resources\n\n[\n\n**Loogle!** A Lean and Mathlib search tool for finding definitions and lemmas,\navailable on the web, via CLI or through IDE extensions.\n\nOPEN\n][17][\n\n**LeanExplore** A natural language search engine for Lean declarations, indexing\ncommonly used Lean libraries.\n\nOPEN\n][18][\n\n**LeanSearch** A Mathlib search engine for finding tactics and theorems via\nnatural language queries.\n\nOPEN\n][19][\n\n**LeanDojo** A tool for data extraction and interacting with Lean\nprogrammatically.\n\nOPEN\n][20][\n\n**REPL** An interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) for Lean intended for\nmachine-to-machine interaction and AI applications.\n\nOPEN\n][21][\n\n**Pantograph** A machine-to-machine interaction system that provides interfaces\nto execute proofs, construct expressions, and examine the symbol list of a Lean\nproject for machine learning.\n\nOPEN\n][22][\n\n**Lean4Web** A web-based version of Lean that allows you to run Lean code\ndirectly in your browser.\n\nOPEN\n][23]\n\n## How to cite Lean\n\n### Lean 4\n\nTo cite Lean 4 please reference [The Lean 4 Theorem Prover and Programming\nLanguage][24] published in CADE-28 - The 28th International Conference on\nAutomated Deduction.

It addresses many shortcomings of the previous versions \nand contains many new features. Lean 4 is fully extensible: users can modify and\n extend the parser, elaborator, tactics, decision procedures, pretty printer, an\nd code generator. The new system has a hygienic macro system custom-built for IT\nPs. It contains a new typeclass resolution procedure based on tabled resolution,\n addressing significant performance problems reported by the growing user base. \nLean 4 is also an efficient functional programming language based on a novel pro\ngramming paradigm called functional but in-place. Efficient code generation is c\nrucial for Lean users because many write custom proof automation procedures in L\nean itself.},\n  booktitle = {Automated Deduction – CADE 28: 28th International Conference on A\nutomated Deduction, Virtual Event, July 12–15, 2021, Proceedings},\n  pages = {625–635},\n  numpages = {11}\n}\n\n### Lean 3\n\nTo cite Lean 3 please reference [The Lean Theorem Prover (System\nDescription)][26] published in *Lecture Notes in Computer Science*.
