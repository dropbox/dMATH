  "content": "* Z3 JavaScript\nOn this page\n\n# Z3 JavaScript\n\nThe Z3 distribution comes with TypeScript (and therefore JavaScript) bindings\nfor Z3. In the following we give a few examples of using Z3 through these\nbindings. You can run and modify the examples locally in your browser.\n\ninfo\n\nThe bindings do not support all features of z3. For example, you cannot (yet)\ncreate array expressions in the same way that you can create arithmetic\nexpressions. The JavaScript bindings have the distinct advantage that they let\nyou use z3 directly in your browser with minimal extra dependencies.\n\n## Warmup[​][1]\n\nWe use a collection of basic examples to illustrate the bindings. The first\nexample is a formula that establishes that there is no number both above 9 and\nbelow 10:\n\nRun\n\nWe note that the JavaScript bindings wrap z3 expressions into JavaScript options\nthat support methods for building new expressions. For example, the method `ge`\nis available on an arithmetic expression `a`. It takes one argument `b` and\nreturns and expression corresponding to the predicate `a >= b`. The `Z3.solve`\nmethod takes a sequence of predicates and checks if there is a solution. If\nthere is a solution, it returns a model.\n\n## Propositional Logic[​][2]\n\nProve De Morgan's Law\n\nRun\n\nWhat not to wear? It is well-known that developers of SAT solvers have\ndifficulties looking sharp. They like to wear some combination of shirt and tie,\nbut can't wear both. What should a SAT solver developer wear?\n\nRun\n\n## Integer Arithmetic[​][3]\n\nsolve `x > 2 and y < 10 and x + 2y = 7`\n\nRun\n\n### Dogs, cats and mice[​][4]\n\nGiven 100 dollars, the puzzle asks if it is possible to buy 100 animals based on\ntheir prices that are 15, 1, and 0.25 dollars, respectively.\n\nRun\n\n## Arrays[​][5]\n\nArrays use the methods `select` and `store` to access and update elements. Note\nthat arrays are static and these operations return new arrays.\n\n### Prove `Store(arr, idx, val)[idx] == val`[​][6]\n\nRun\n\n### Find unequal arrays with the same sum[​][7]\n\nWe illustrate how to use the solver in finding assignments of array values that\nsatisfy a given predicate. In this example, we want to find two arrays of length\n4 that have the same sum, but are not equal:\n\nRun\n\n## Uninterpreted Functions[​][8]\n\nThe method `call` is used to build expressions by applying the function node to\narguments.\n\n### Prove `x = y implies g(x) = g(y)`[​][9]\n\nRun\n\n### Disprove `x = y implies g(g(x)) = g(y)`[​][10]\n\nwe illustrate the use of the `Solver` object in the following example. Instead\nof calling `Z3.solve` we here create a solver object and add assertions to it.\nThe `solver.check()` method is used to check satisfiability (we expect the\nresult to be `sat` for this example). The method `solver.model()` is used to\nretrieve a model:\n\nRun\n\n### Prove `x = y implies g(x) = g(y)`[​][11]\n\nRun\n\n### Disprove that `x = y implies g(g(x)) = g(y)`[​][12]\n\nRun\n\n## Solve sudoku[​][13]\n\nThe popular Sudoku can be solved.\n\nRun\n\nThe encoding used in the following example uses arithmetic. It works here, but\nis not the only possible encoding approach. You can also use bit-vectors for the\ncells. It is generally better to use bit-vectors for finite domain problems in\nz3.\n\n## Arithmetic over Reals[​][14]\n\nYou can create constants ranging over reals from strings that use fractions,\ndecimal notation and from floating point numbers.\n\nRun\n\nZ3 uses arbitrary precision arithmetic, so decimal positions are not truncated\nwhen you use strings to represent real numerals.\n\nRun\n\n## Non-linear arithmetic[​][15]\n\nZ3 uses a decision procedure for non-linear arithmetic over reals. It is based\non Cylindric Algebraic Decomposition. Solutions to non-linear arithmetic\nformulas are no longer necessarily rational. They are represented as *algebraic\nnumbers* in general and can be displayed with any number of decimal position\nprecision.\n\nRun\n\n## Bit-vectors[​][16]\n\nUnlike in programming languages, there is no distinction between signed and\nunsigned bit-vectors. Instead the API supports operations that have different\nmeaning depending on whether a bit-vector is treated as a signed or unsigned\nnumeral. These are signed comparison and signed division, remainder operations.\n\nIn the following we illustrate the use of signed and unsigned\nless-than-or-equal:\n\nRun\n\nIt is easy to write formulas that mix bit-wise and arithmetic operations over\nbit-vectors.\n\nRun\n\n## Using Z3 objects wrapped in JavaScript[​][17]\n\nThe following example illustrates the use of AstVector:\n\nRun\n[Edit this page][18]\n\n[1]: #warmup\n[2]: #propositional-logic\n[3]: #integer-arithmetic\n[4]: #dogs-cats-and-mice\n[5]: #arrays\n[6]: #prove-storearr-idx-validx--val\n[7]: #find-unequal-arrays-with-the-same-sum\n[8]: #uninterpreted-functions\n[9]: #prove-x--y-implies-gx--gy\n[10]: #disprove-x--y-implies-ggx--gy\n[11]: #prove-x--y-implies-gx--gy-1\n[12]: #disprove-that-x--y-implies-ggx--gy\n[13]: #solve-sudoku\n[14]: #arithmetic-over-reals\n[15]: #non-linear-arithmetic\n[16]: #bit-vectors\n[17]: #using-z3-objects-wrapped-in-javascript\n[18]: https://github.com/microsoft/z3guide/tree/main/website/docs-programming/01\n - Z3 JavaScript Examples.md\n",
