[[Deepchecks Continuous Validation: Testing, CI & Monitoring]][1]

# Welcome to Deepchecks![#][2]

[Deepchecks][3] is a holistic open-source solution for all of your AI & ML validation needs,
enabling you to thoroughly test your data and models from research to production.

We invite you to:

* See the following [Deepchecks Components][4] section for more info about the Testing, CI, &
  Monitoring components and for links to their corresponding documentation.
* Go to the [Get Started with Deepchecks Monitoring][5] section to have it up and running quickly
  and see it in action.

## Deepchecks’ Components for Continuous Validation[#][7]

Deepchecks provides comprehensive support for your testing requirements, from examining data
integrity and assessing distributions, to validating data splits, comparing models and evaluating
their performance across the model’s entire development process.

Testing Docs (here)

Tests during research and model development

CI Docs

Tests before deploying the model to production

Monitoring Docs

Tests and continuous monitoring during production

Deechecks’ continuous validation approach is based on testing the ML models and data throughout
their lifecycle using the exact same checks, enabling a simple, elaborate and seamless experience
for configuring and consuming the results. Each phase has its relevant interfaces (e.g. visual
outputs, python/json output results, alert configuration, push notifications, RCA, etc.) for
interacting with the test results.
