**LangSmith provides tools for developing, debugging, and deploying LLM applications.** It helps you
trace requests, evaluate outputs, test prompts, and manage deployments in one place. LangSmith is
framework agnostic, so you can use it with or without LangChain’s open-source libraries
[`langchain`][1] and [`langgraph`][2]. Prototype locally, then move to production with integrated
monitoring and evaluation to build more reliable AI systems.
LangGraph Platform is now [LangSmith Deployment][3]. For more information, check out the
[Changelog][4].
