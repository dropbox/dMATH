## The nuXmv model checker
## **

**nuXmv** is a new symbolic model checker for the analysis of synchronous finite-state and
infinite-state systems.

nuXmv extends [NuSMV][1] along two main directions:

* For the finite-state case, nuXmv features a strong verification engine based on state-of-the-art
  SAT-based algorithms.
* For the infinite-state case, nuXmv features SMT-based verification techniques, implemented through
  a tight integration with [MathSAT5][2].

See the complete list of [features][3] provided by nuXmv, or have a look at the [User Manual
(pdf)][4].

nuXmv is currently licensed in binary form, for non-commercial or academic purposes.

The list of nuXmv users is open for registration and discussion:

nuXmv has been applied in several [Related Projects][5].

nuXmv is used as a back-end in several [other tools][6] for [requirements analysis][7], [contract
based design][8], [model checking of hybrid systems][9], [safety assessment][10], and [software
model checking][11].
