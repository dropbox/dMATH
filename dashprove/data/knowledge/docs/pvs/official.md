# PVS

PVS is a mechanized environment for formal specification and verification. PVS consists of a
specification language, a large number of predefined theories, a type checker, an interactive
theorem prover that supports the use of several decision procedures and a symbolic model checker,
various utilities including a code generator and a random tester, documentation, formalized
libraries, and examples that illustrate different methods of using the system in several application
areas. By exploiting the synergy between a highly expressive specification language and powerful
automated deduction, PVS serves as a productive environment for constructing and maintaining large
formalizations and proofs. See the [description][25] page for a summary of the features of PVS, and
the [documentation][26] page for full details.

PVS builds on over 40 years of experience at SRI in developing and using tools to support formal
methods. See [fm.csl.sri.com][27] for a description of formal methods at SRI, and some of our formal
methods tools.

## NASA and PVS

PVS has had many contributors over the years, but would probably not even exist without the
continuing support and encouragement from the [ NASA Langley Formal Methods Research Program][28].
They have been with us from the beginning, and have put together a huge [library of PVS
theories][29] that are freely available. It is highly recommended that you download and use these,
both as libraries and as examples of complex PVS specifications and proofs. Many of the tools
currently in PVS were developed by this group. Check out the [link][30] for details on PVS related
research sponsored by NASA. There you can even learn about how the NASA PVS Library was featured in
the movie ["The Martian"][31]

## How to get PVS

PVS 7.1 ([release notes][32]) is the current stable version of the tool. There are free versions for
Linux and Mac, for both Allegro and SBCL Common Lisp. Allegro has more features, and is generally
quite a bit faster, but requires acceptance of a click-through license. If you are a commercial
entity and you don't already have a PVS license (any version), or have licensing questions, please
contact us at [pvs-licensing@csl.sri.com][33]

PVS sources are available on [Github][34].
