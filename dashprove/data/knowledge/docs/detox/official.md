# Detox benefits

### Cross Platform

Write cross-platform end-to-end tests in JavaScript. Currently supports iOS and Android.

### Debuggable

Modern async-await API allows breakpoints in asynchronous tests to work as expected.

### Automatically Synchronized

Stops flakiness at the core by monitoring asynchronous operations in your app.

### Made For CI

Execute your E2E tests on CI platforms like Travis CI, CircleCI or Jenkins without grief.

### Runs on Devices

Gain confidence to ship by testing your app on a device/simulator just like a real user (not yet
supported on iOS).

### Test Runner Agnostic

Detox provides a set of APIs to use with any test runner or without it. It comes with [Jest][1]
integration out of the box.
