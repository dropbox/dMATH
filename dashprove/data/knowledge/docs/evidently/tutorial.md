Evidently helps evaluate, test, and monitor data and AI-powered systems.

* Evidently is an **open-source Python library** with over 25 million downloads. It provides 100+
  evaluation metrics, a declarative testing API, and a lightweight visual interface to explore the
  results.
* **Evidently Cloud platform** offers a complete toolkit for AI testing and observability. It
  includes tracing, synthetic data generation, dataset management, eval orchestration, alerting and
  a no-code interface for domain experts to collaborate on AI quality.
Our goal is to help teams build and maintain reliable, high-performing AI products: from predictive
ML models to complex LLM-powered systems.
