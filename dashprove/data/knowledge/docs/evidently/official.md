why ai testing matters

## AI fails differently

Non-deterministic AI systems break in ways traditional software doesn’t.
Hallucinations
LLMs confidently make things up.
Edge cases
Unexpected inputs bring the quality down.
**Data & PII leaks**
Sensitive data slips into responses.
**Risky outputs**
From competitor mentions to unsafe content.
**Jailbreaks**
Bad actors hijack your AI with clever prompts.
**Cascading errors**
One wrong step and the whole chain collapses.

what we do

## LLM evaluation platform

From generating test cases to delivering proof your AI system is ready.
[Icon]
**Automated evaluation**
Measure output accuracy, safety, and quality. Get a clear, shareable report showing exactly where AI
breaks — down to each response.
[Icon]
**Synthetic data**
Create realistic, edge-case, and adversarial inputs tailored to your use case — from harmless
prompts to hostile attacks.
[Icon]
**Continuous testing**
AI testing isn’t a one-time check. Track performance across every update with a live dashboard — so
you catch drift, regressions, and emerging risks early.

testimonials

## Trusted by AI teams worldwide

Evidently is used in 1000s of companies, from startups to enterprise.
[Dayle Fernandes]
**Dayle Fernandes**
MLOps Engineer, DeepL
"We use Evidently daily to test data quality and monitor production data drift. It takes away a lot
of headache of building monitoring suites, so we can focus on how to react to monitoring results.
Evidently is a very well-built and polished tool. It is like a Swiss army knife we use more often
than expected."
[Iaroslav Polianskii]
**Iaroslav Polianskii**
Senior Data Scientist, Wise
[Egor Kraev]
**Egor Kraev**
Head of AI, Wise
"At Wise, Evidently proved to be a great solution for monitoring data distribution in our production
environment and linking model performance metrics directly to training data. Its wide range of
functionality, user-friendly visualization, and detailed documentation make Evidently a flexible and
effective tool for our work. These features allow us to maintain robust model performance and make
informed decisions about our machine learning systems."
[Alexey Grigorev]
**Alexey Grigorev**
Founder [DataTalks.Club][37]
"We've run the MLOps Zoomcamp at DataTalks.Club for 4 years for thousands of ML practitioners, with
ML observability modules showcasing Evidently. It's a tool the ML engineering community consistently
relies on: it regularly ranks as one of the most popular ML and LLMOps tools in our surveys. It's
open-source, lightweight but powerful – just how AI/ML tooling should be."
[Demetris Papadopoulos]
**Demetris Papadopoulos**
Director of Engineering, Martech, Flo Health
"Evidently is a neat and easy to use product. My team built and owns the business' ML platform, and
Evidently has been one of our choices for its composition. Our model performance monitoring module
with Evidently at its core allows us to keep an eye on our productionized models and act early."
[Moe Antar]
**Moe Antar**
Senior Data Engineer, PlushCare
"We use Evidently to continuously monitor our business-critical ML models at all stages of the ML
lifecycle. It has become an invaluable tool, enabling us to flag model drift and data quality issues
directly from our CI/CD and model monitoring DAGs. We can proactively address potential issues
before they impact our end users."
[Jonathan Bown]
**Jonathan Bown**
MLOps Engineer, Western Governors University
"The user experience of our MLOps platform has been greatly enhanced by integrating Evidently
alongside MLflow. Evidently's preset tests and metrics expedited the provisioning of our
infrastructure with the tools for monitoring models in production. Evidently enhanced the
flexibility of our platform for data scientists to further customize tests, metrics, and reports to
meet their unique requirements."

**Evan Lutins**
Machine Learning Engineer, Realtor.com
"At Realtor.com, we implemented a production-level feature drift pipeline with Evidently. This
allows us detect anomalies, missing values, newly introduced categorical values, or other oddities
in upstream data sources that we do not want to be fed into our models. Evidently's intuitive
interface and thorough documentation allowed us to iterate and roll out a drift pipeline rather
quickly."
[Valentin Min]
**Ming-Ju Valentine Lin**
ML Infrastructure Engineer, Plaid
"We use Evidently for continuous model monitoring, comparing daily inference logs to corresponding
days from the previous week and against initial training data. This practice prevents score drifts
across minor versions and ensures our models remain fresh and relevant. Evidently’s comprehensive
suite of tests has proven invaluable, greatly improving our model reliability and operational
efficiency."
[Javier Lopez Peña]
**Javier López Peña**
Data Science Manager, Wayflyer
"Evidently is a fantastic tool! We find it incredibly useful to run the data quality reports during
EDA and identify features that might be unstable or require further engineering. The Evidently
reports are a substantial component of our Model Cards as well. We are now expanding to production
monitoring."
[Ben Wilson]

Principal RSA, Databricks
"Check out Evidently: I haven't seen a more promising model drift detection framework released to
open-source yet!"
[Maltzahn]
**Niklas von Maltzahn**
Head of Decision Science, JUMO
"Evidently is a first-of-its-kind monitoring tool that makes debugging machine learning models
simple and interactive. It's really easy to get started!"
