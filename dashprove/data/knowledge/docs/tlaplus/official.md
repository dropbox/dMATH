 │You'll miss a lot on this web site unless you enable Javascript in your browser.                  
 │I am the creator of TLA+, a high-level language for modeling programs and systems--especially     
 │concurrent and distributed ones. It's based on the idea that the best way to describe things      
 │precisely is with simple mathematics. TLA+ and its tools are useful for eliminating fundamental   
 │design errors, which are hard to find and expensive to correct in code.

 │This web page is the home page of what used to be the TLA+ web site. TLA+ is now in the hands of  
 │the [TLA+ Foundation][1], and this is now my personal TLA+ web site. I have retired, and I don't  
 │know if I will make any further changes to the site other than correcting errors in it. I welcome 
 │suggestions for what modifications or additions would be worth making. Instructions for contacting
 │me are on [my home page][2]. Below are links to the top-level sections of this web site.
