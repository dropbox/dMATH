A code bug is when the code\ndoesn’t match our design— for example, an off-by-one error, or a null\ndereference. We have lots of techniques for finding code bugs. But what about\ndesign flaws? When it comes to bugs in our designs, we’re just taught to “think\nabout it really hard”.\n\nTLA+ is a “formal specification language”, a means of designing systems that\nlets you directly test those designs. Developed by the Turing award-winner\nLeslie Lamport, TLA+ has been endorsed by companies like AWS, Microsoft, and\nCrowdStrike. TLA+ doesn’t replace our engineering skill but *augments* it. With\nTLA+ we can design systems faster and more confidently. Check out the\n[Conceptual Overview][20] to see an example of this in practice.\n\n## About this guide[¶][21]\n\nThis is a free online resource for learning TLA+. To help both beginners and\nexperienced users, the guide is divided into three parts:\n\n* The [Core][22]: a linear introduction to all of the TLA+ language. It starts\n  with basic operators and gradually progresses all the way to advanced topics.\n  The core is intended to be read **linearly**: people new to TLA+ should start\n  with the conceptual overview and then work forward from there. People\n  comfortable with TLA+ should skim until they find new material.\n* [Topics][23]: “Optional” advanced material. Any individual lesson will be\n  useful to *many* but not *all* TLA+ users. Unlike the core, these are designed\n  to be mostly independent of each other. If topics have dependencies on other\n  topics, I will call them out.\n* [Examples][24]: Applications of TLA+ to specs, showing both how to write and\n  understand specs.\n\nThis guide is still under development, check [What’s New][25] to see most recent\nupdates and the [roadmap][26] to see what I’m currently working on.\n\n## About Me[¶][27]\n\nI’m Hillel. I’m part of the TLA+ foundation and the author of the book\n[Practical TLA+][28]. I wrote this because I want TLA+ to be as accessible as\npossible and didn’t like that my book cost money. I have a [blog][29] and a\n[weekly newsletter][30].\n\n(Full disclosure, I’m also a [professional TLA+ consultant][31] and <plug>run\nworkshops</plug>.)\n\n[<Page contents][32]\n\n[>Page contents:][33]\n\n* [Learn TLA+][34]\n  \n  * [About this guide][35]\n  * [About Me][36]\n    \n[FAQ>][37]\n© Copyright 2022, Hillel Wayne.
