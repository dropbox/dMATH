# **NuSMV: a new symbolic model checker**

[NuSMV][1] is a symbolic model checker developed as a joint project between:

* The [Embedded Systems Unit][2] in the [Digital Industry Center][3] at [FBK-IRST][4]
* The [Model Checking][5] group at [Carnegie Mellon University][6], the Mechanized Reasoning Group
  at [University of Genova][7]
* The Mechanized Reasoning Group at [University of Trento][8].

[NuSMV][9] is a reimplementation and extension of [SMV¹][10], the first model checker based on BDDs.
[NuSMV][11] has been designed to be an open architecture for model checking, which can be reliably
used for the verification of industrial designs, as a core for custom verification tools, as a
testbed for formal verification techniques, and applied to other research areas.

NuSMV2, combines BDD-based model checking component that exploits the CUDD library developed by
Fabio Somenzi at Colorado University and SAT-based model checking component that includes an
RBC-based Bounded Model Checker, which can be connected to the [Minisat SAT Solver][12].
