# Apache TVM

An Open Machine Learning Compiler Framework

[Learn More][19]

Apache TVM is a machine learning compilation framework, following the principle of Python-first
development and universal deployment. It takes in pre-trained machine learning models, compiles and
generates deployable modules that can be embedded and run everywhere.

* #### About Apache TVM
  
  The vision of the Apache TVM Project is to host a diverse community of experts and practitioners
  in machine learning, compilers, and systems architecture to build an accessible, flexible, and
  efficient open-source framework that optimizes current and emerging machine learning models for
  any hardware platform. TVM provides the following main features:
  
  * Python-first development that enables quick customization of machine learning compiler
    pipelines.
  * Universal deployment to bring models into minimum deployable modules.

## Key Features & Capabilities
