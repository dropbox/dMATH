## Learn How to Use KLEE

**NOTE: This is the documentation for the version of KLEE in the master branch, which might differ
from released KLEE. For documentation relevant to a particular KLEE release see [the releases
page][1].**

### If you have a question on using KLEE:

1. Please first check the documentation below
2. Then check the [searchable mailing list archive][2]
3. If this still doesn’t answer your questions then:
   
   * If you think it is a bug, please open an [issue on GitHub][3]
   * If it is a general question, then please send an email to the [klee-dev mailing list][4]

## Usage

8. [Coreutils Experiments][12]: Some information about the Coreutils experiments presented in our
   [KLEE OSDI’08 paper][13].

## Tutorials

1. [First tutorial][14]: Testing a small function.
2. [Second tutorial][15]: Testing a simple regular expression library.
3. [Using a symbolic environment][16]: Guide with examples on how to use the symbolic environment
   such as symbolic files and command-line arguments for the program under test.
4. [Testing Coreutils][17]: In-depth description of how to use KLEE to test GNU Coreutils.

## External Resources

We also recommend the following external resources. When using them, please take into account that
they might be using old versions of KLEE.

1.  [Symbolic execution with KLEE][18]: A set of four instructional videos introducing KLEE,
    starting with how to get started with KLEE and ending with a demo that finds memory corruption
    bugs in real code.
2.  [Solving a maze with KLEE][19]: A nice explanation of how symbolic execution can be used to
    generate interesting program inputs. The example shows how to use KLEE to find all the solutions
    to a maze game.

    solve a small binary’s pseudocode.
4.  [Keygenning with KLEE][21]: A more in-depth guide to using KLEE for key generation.

    KLEE.
6.  [Using KLEE to generate tests for binary search][23]: A tutorial on using KLEE to test a binary
    search implementation).
7.  [A Guide to KLEE LLVM Execution Engine Internals][24]: A quick overview of KLEE’s internals and
    core classes in [PoC||GTFO][25] 0x18 (pp. 51).

    Rust programs with KLEE.
9.  [SAT/SMT by example][27]: A comprehensive guide focusing on using SAT and SMT solvers, which
    includes lots of interesting examples involving KLEE.
10. [Measuring the coverage achieved by symbolic execution][28]: A blog post that discusses the
    difference between the internal coverage reported by KLEE and the external coverage reported by
    a tool such as GCov.
11. [Binary symbolic execution with KLEE-Native][29]: An extension of KLEE that analyses binaries by
    lifting them to LLVM IR
