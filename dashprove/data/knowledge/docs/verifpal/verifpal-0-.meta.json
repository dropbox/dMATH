  "content": "# Verifpal^{®}\n\nVerifpal^{®} is new software for verifying the security of cryptographic\nprotocols. Building upon contemporary research in symbolic formal verification,\nVerifpal’s main aim is to appeal more to real-world practitioners, students and\nengineers without sacrificing comprehensive formal verification features.\n\nIn order to achieve this, Verifpal introduces a new, intuitive language for\nmodeling protocols that is much easier to write and understand than the\nlanguages employed by existing tools. At the same time, Verifpal is able to\nmodel protocols under an active attacker with unbounded sessions and fresh\nvalues, and supports queries for advanced security properties such as forward\nsecrecy or key compromise impersonation.\n\nVerifpal has already been used to verify security properties for Signal,\nScuttlebutt, TLS 1.3, Telegram and other protocols. It is a community-focused\nproject, and available under a GPLv3 license.\n\n### An Intuitive Protocol Modeling Language\n\nThe Verifpal language is meant to illustrate protocols close to how one may\ndescribe them in an informal conversation, while still being precise and\nexpressive enough for formal modeling.\n\n### Modeling that Avoids User Error\n\nVerifpal does not allow users to define their own cryptographic primitives.\nInstead, it comes with built-in cryptographic functions — this is meant to\nremove the potential for users to define fundamental cryptographic operations\nincorrectly.\n\n### Easy to Understand Analysis Output\n\nWhen a contradiction is found for a query, the result is related in a readable\nformat that ties the attack to a real-world scenario. This is done by using\nterminology to indicate how the attack could have been possible.\n\n### Friendly and Integrated Software\n\nVerifpal comes with a Visual Studio Code extension that offers syntax\nhighlighting, live query analysis, protocol diagram visualizations and more,\nallowing developers to obtain insights on their model as they are writing it.\n\nCheck out [this cool three-minute demonstration of how Verifpal can be used to\nmodel a protocol with properties such as forward secrecy on YouTube!][1]\n\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrJt6hOAQlQ\n",
