# Alloy web tutorial pointer

The original Alloy online tutorial used HTML frames that did not render in the automatic scraper. The main tutorial content now lives at `https://alloytools.org/tutorials/online/maintext-default.html`, with linked examples and sidebar models. Use that page as the canonical walkthrough for Alloy 4.0, covering syntax basics, scope selection, instance generation, and analyzer commands. When browsing offline copies, load the maintext page directly to read the lesson text and follow links to the current model and sidenotes.
