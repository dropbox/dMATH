### Objectives

* ***Configurable Verification Platform***
  
  CPAchecker is a tool for configurable software verification. Our implementation is guided by the
  concepts described in the CAV'07 paper "Configurable Software Verification" and in the ASE'08
  paper "Program Analysis with Dynamic Precision Adjustment".

The name **CPAchecker** was chosen to reflect that the tool is based on the CPA concepts and is used
for checking software programs.

  The CPAchecker team receives a Goedel medal at the Vienna Summer of Logic during the [Awards
  Ceremony from Edmund Clarke][14] (Photo VSL/Meister), “for their contributions to the development
  of efficient verification methods and algorithms, for technology transfer by implementing the
  techniques in robust software systems, and for the successful participation of their verifiers in
  the last three years of SV-COMP.”
