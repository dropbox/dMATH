  workflows, and role-based access control for seamless team coordination
* **Continuous red teaming** - Continuous threat detection for new vulnerabilities with automated
  scanning and monitoring capabilities
* **Access control** - Manage who can see what data and run which tests across your organization
* **Dataset management** - Centralized storage and versioning of test cases for consistent testing
* **Custom failure categories** - Define and categorize your own failure types beyond standard
  security and business logic issues
* **Enterprise compliance features** - 2FA, audit logs, SSO, and enterprise-grade security controls
* **Custom business checks** - Create and deploy your own specialized testing logic and validation
  rules
* **Alerting** - Get notified when issues are detected with configurable notification systems
* **Evaluations** - Agent evaluations with cron-based scheduling for continuous monitoring
* **Knowledge bases** - Store and manage domain knowledge to enhance testing scenarios

## Open source

**Giskard Open Source** is a Python library for LLM testing and evaluation. It is available on
[GitHub][4] and formed the basis for our course on Red Teaming LLM Applications on
[Deeplearning.AI][5].

The library provides a set of tools for testing and evaluating LLMs, including:

* Automated detection of security vulnerabilities using LLM Scan.
* Automated detection of business logic failures using RAG Evaluation Toolkit.
Giskard Open Source

As a developer, you can use the Open Source SDK to get familiar with basic testset generation for
business and security failures.

[Quickstart & setup][6]
Deeplearning.AI ↗

Our course on red teaming LLM applications on Deeplearning.AI helps you understand how to test, red
team and evaluate LLM applications.

## Open research

**Giskard Research** contributes to research on AI safety and security to showcase and understand
the latest advancements in the field. Some work has been funded by the [the European Commission][9],
[Bpifrance][10], and we’ve collaborated with leading AI research organizations like the [AI Incident
Database][11] and [Google DeepMind][12].

Phare

Phare is a multilingual benchmark to evaluate LLMs across key safety & security dimensions,
including hallucination, factual accuracy, bias, and potential harm.

* [Phare website][13]
* [Phare arXiv paper][14]
RealHarm

RealHarm is a dataset of problematic interactions with textual AI agents built from a systematic
review of publicly reported incidents.

* [RealHarm website][15]
* [RealHarm arXiv paper][16]
RealPerformance

RealPerformance is a dataset of functional issues of language models that mirrors failure patterns
identified through rigorous testing in real LLM agents.
