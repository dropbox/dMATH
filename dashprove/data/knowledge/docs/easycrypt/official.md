## EasyCrypt

EasyCrypt is an interactive framework for verifying the security of cryptographic constructions in
the computational model. EasyCrypt adopts the codebased approach, in which security goals and
hardness assumptions are modelled as probabilistic programs (called experiments or games) with
unspecified adversarial code, and uses tools issued from program verification and programming
language theory to rigorously justify cryptographic reasoning.

EasyCrypt is part of the [Formosa project][1].
