# Does your program do what it is supposed to do?

OpenJML is a program verification tool for Java programs that allows you to check the specifications
of programs annotated in the Java Modeling Language.

## Verify Your Java Programs with JML

The [Java Modeling Language][11] (JML) is a mature program specification language with more than two
decades of history. OpenJML is capable of checking Java programs annotated with specifications in
the Java Modeling Language and provides robust support for many of JML's features. That is, OpenJML
does deductive program verification to check that a program's implementation (in Java) satisfies its
specification (in JML). OpenJML can also perform runtime-assertion-checking.

The goal of the OpenJML project is to implement a full tool for JML and current Java that is easy
for practioners and students to use to specify and verify Java programs. In addition, the project
seeks to advance the theory and experience of software verification in practical,
industrially-relevant contexts.

## Support for Static and Runtime Checking

Verification in OpenJML can be performed either by using our static deductive verification
capability or by using our runtime assertion checking features. Runtime assertion checking is often
easier to write specifications for whereas static checking gives stronger guarantees about program
behavior.

The project's development home is now GitHub, after residing on SourceForge for many years; our
Eclipse plug-in will be there again one it is up and running. SourceForge recognized the project as
an active download site.
