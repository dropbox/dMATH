# Introduction

## Overview

Welcome to ZAP API Documentation! The [Zed Attack Proxy][1] (**ZAP**) is one of the world's most
popular free security tools which lets you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your
applications. ZAP also has an extremely powerful API that allows you to do nearly everything that is
possible via the desktop interface. This allows the developers to automate pentesting and security
regression testing of the application in the CI/CD pipeline.

This document provides example guides & API definitions for ZAP APIs. You can view code examples in
the dark area to the right; switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs on the top
right. If anything is missing or seems incorrect, please check the [FAQs][2] or the [GitHub
issues][3] for existing known issues. Also, if you are new to ZAP, then check out the [getting
started guide][4] to learn the basic concepts behind ZAP.

An [OpenAPI definition][5] for the ZAP API is [available in the main repository][6], which can be
used to generate custom API clients. This definition is planned to be kept up to date for the latest
core and add-on releases. Note that currently the definition does not declare the most appropriate
types for the parameters and does not contain the responses.

The following are some of the features provided by ZAP:

* Intercepting Proxy
* Active and Passive Scanners
* Traditional and Ajax Spiders
* Brute Force Scanner
* Port Scanner
* Web Sockets

Have a look at the examples below to learn how to use each of these features via ZAP API.

## Documentation Structure

The API documentation is divided into nine main sections.

* [**Introduction**][7] section contains introductory information of ZAP and installation guide to
  set up ZAP for testing.
* [**Exploring the App**][8] section contains examples on how to explore the web application.
* [**Attacking the App**][9] section contains examples on how to scan or attack a web application.
* [**Getting the Results**][10] section contains examples on how to retrieve alerts and generate
  Reports from ZAP.
* [**Getting Authenticated**][11] section contains examples on how to authenticate the web
  application with ZAP.
* [**Advanced Settings**][12] section contains advanced configurations on how to fine tune ZAP
  results.
* [**Contributions**][13] section contains guidelines and instructions on how to contribute to ZAP's
  documentation.
* [**API Catalogue**][14] section contains OpenAPI definitions and auto generated code for ZAP APIs.
* [**Troubleshooting**][15] section contains solutions for trouble shooting ZAP API related issues.
The examples show some usages with the minimal required arguments. However, this is not a reference,
and not all APIs nor arguments are shown. View the API catalogue to see all the parameters and scope
of each API.

## Basics on the API Request

ZAP APIs provide access to most of the core features of ZAP such as the active scanner and spider.
ZAP API is enabled by default in the daemon mode and the desktop mode. If you are using ZAP desktop,
then the API can be configured by visiting the following screen:

`Tools -> Options -> API`.

[zap_desktop_api]

ZAP requires an API Key to perform specific actions via the REST API. The API key must be specified
on all API 'actions' and some 'other' operations. The API key is used to prevent malicious sites
from accessing ZAP APIs. It is strongly recommended that you set a key unless you are using ZAP in a
completely isolated environment. Also make sure that you have installed the necessary add-ons while
invoking features which are not bundled with the ZAP core. For example, if you receive
"no_implementor error" in relation to Ajax Spider calls, perhaps the Ajax Spider add-on isn't
installed.

Please note that not all the operations which are available in the desktop interface are available
via the APIs. Future versions of ZAP will increase the functionality/scope available via the APIs.

### API URL Format

The API is available via `GET` and `POST` endpoints and the response is available in `JSON`, `XML`,
`HTML`, and `OTHER` (custom formats, e.g. HAR) formats. All the response formats return the same
information, just in a different format. Based on the use case, choose the appropriate format. For
example, to generate easily readable reports use the HTML format and use XML/JSON based response to
parse the results quickly.

The following example shows the API URL format of ZAP:

`http://zap/<format>/<component>/<operation>/<operation name>[/?<parameters>]`

The format can be either `JSON`, `XML` or `HTML`. The operation can be either `view` or `action` or
`other`. The `view` operation is used to return information and the `action` is used to control ZAP.
For example, `views` can be used to generated reports or retrieve results and `action` can be used
to start or stop the Spider. The components, operation names and parameters can all be discovered by
browsing the [API Catalogue][16].

### Access the API

The REST API can be accessed directly or via one of the [client implementations][17] detailed below.
A simple web UI is also available to explore and use the APIs via the browser. This web UI can be
accessed via [http://zap/][18] when you are proxying through ZAP, or via the host and port ZAP is
listening on, e.g. [http://localhost:8080/][19].

[zap_api_ui]

By default only the machine ZAP is running on is able to access the APIs. You can [allow other
machines][20], that are able to use ZAP as a proxy, access to the API.

### Client SDKs

API clients are available for the following languages:

## Quick Setup Guide

The quick setup guide focuses on setting up *ZAP* and a testing application. If you have already
setup ZAP then Jump to specific [example][29] to experiment with specific features.

### Start ZAP

`# For Linux, Option: 1, using "headless/daemon" mode
<ZAP_HOME>./zap.sh -daemon -config api.key=change-me-9203935709
# For Linux, Option: 2, using ZAP desktop App
<ZAP_HOME>./zap.sh

# For Windows, Run the exe file or zap.bat script to start ZAP
`
`// For Linux, Option: 1, using "headless/daemon" mode
<ZAP_HOME>./zap.sh -daemon -config api.key=change-me-9203935709
// For Linux, Option: 2, using ZAP desktop App
<ZAP_HOME>./zap.sh

// For Windows, Run the exe file or zap.bat script to start ZAP
`
`# For Linux, Option: 1, using "headless/daemon" mode
$ <ZAP_HOME>./zap.sh -daemon -config api.key=change-me-9203935709
# For Linux, Option: 2, using ZAP desktop App
$ <ZAP_HOME>./zap.sh 

# For Windows, Run the exe file or zap.bat script to start ZAP
`

To install ZAP, go to ZAP's [home page][30] and download the installer specific to the operating
system. After extracting the bundle you can start ZAP by issuing the following command shown in the
right column.

The API key must be specified on all API `actions` and some `other` operations. The API key is used
to prevent malicious sites from accessing ZAP API.

### Setup a Testing Application

If you already have a website to scan or to perform security testing, then obtain the URL/IP of the
application to begin the scanning. The example guide uses [Google's Firing Range][31] and [OWASP
Juice Shop][32] to perform the security testing. The Spidering and Attacking examples use the
[public instance][33] of the Firing Range, and OWASP Juice Shop are used to showcase the
Authentication examples of ZAP.

The following is a [list][34] of publicly available vulnerable applications that you can also used
in conjunction with ZAP.

In many jurisdictions it is illegal to "test" web sites/applications without permission. Please be
aware that you should only use ZAP with targets that you have been specifically given permission to
test.

## Getting Help

All available APIs are documented in the [API Catalogue][35]. If you are new to ZAP, then it's
highly recommended that you experiment with the desktop UI before trying out the APIs. Because ZAP's
APIs strongly resemble the desktop UI. Therefore by working with the UI, you will get a good
understanding on how to orchestrate ZAP's APIs. Also, use the export config functionality from the
desktop UI to export complex configurations such as contexts, scan policies, etc. Then use the
exported configurations when creating the automation scripts.

ZAP has a very friendly and active developer community. Always feel free to raise a question in the
[ZAP users forum][36] or [Stack Overflow][37] for issues related to ZAP. Also, use the [ZAP's GitHub
repository][38] to raise a bug report or to make any feature requests.

Stay tuned on twitter [@zaproxy][39].

# Exploring the App

In order to expose content and functionality for ZAP to test the target the application should be
explored before performing any scan or attack. The more you explore your App the more accurate the
results will be. If the application is not explored very well then it will impact or reduce the
vulnerabilities ZAP can find.

The following are some of the options to explore the site by using ZAP. You can use multiple
approaches in a combination to get more complete coverage of the application.

* **Traditional Spider (Crawler):** Use this approach to crawl the HTML resources (hyperlinks etc)
  in the web application.
* **Ajax Spider:** Use this feature if the application heavily relies with Ajax calls.
* **Proxy Regression / Unit Tests** This is the recommended approach for security regression
  testing. Use this approach to explore the application, if you already have a test suite or unit
  tests in place.
* **OpenAPI/SOAP Definition**: Use this approach if you have a well defined OpenAPI definition. The
  OpenAPI plugin can be downloaded via the marketplace.

The Spider is a tool that is used to automatically discover new resources (URLs) on a particular
site. It begins with a list of URLs to visit, called the seeds, which depends on how the Spider is
started. The Spider then visits these URLs, it identifies all the hyperlinks in the page and adds
them to the list of URLs to visit, and the process continues recursively as long as new resources
are found. Each response type is processed differently in ZAP. All the available endpoints for the
spider can be found in [spider][40] section.

### Start the Spider

The Spiders explore the site and they don't actually do any scanning. The resources crawled by the
Spider(s) are passively scanned in the background via the [Passive Scanner][41]. The [scan][42] API
runs the spider against the given URL. Optionally, the 'maxChildren' parameter can be set to limit
the number of children scanned and the 'recurse' parameter can be used to prevent the spider from
seeding recursively. The parameter 'subtreeOnly' allows to restrict the spider under a site's
subtree (using the specified 'URL'). The parameter 'contextName' can be used to constrain the scan
to a Context. View the [context example][43] to understand how to create a context with ZAP API.

The code sample on the right recursively scans the application with the provided URL. The scan ID is
returned as a response when starting the Spider. Use this scan ID to perform any additional actions
or to retrieve any views from the Spider API.

### View Status

The spider scan is a async request and the time to complete the task will vary depending on the
complexity of the web application. The scan ID returned via starting the spider should be used to
obtain the results of the crawling. Execute the [status][44] API to get the status/percentage of
work done by the Spider.

### View Spider Results

The results of the crawling can be obtained via the [results][45] API. The following image shows the
JSON sample response provided by the results API, listing all the resources crawled by Spider.

[spider results]

### Stop or Pause the Spider

If the scanning takes more time than expected you can stop or pause the scanning via using the
[stop][46] or [pause][47] APIs. Additional APIs are available in the API Catalogue to pause or
resume or to [stop All][48] the scanning processes.

The [advanced section on Spider][49] contains more examples on how to tweak/improve the Spider
results.

## Using Ajax Spider

            String status;

            long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
            long timeout = TimeUnit.MINUTES.toMillis(2); // Two minutes in milli seconds

# To stop the Ajax Spider
$ curl "http://localhost:8080/JSON/ajaxSpider/action/stop/?apikey=<ZAP_API_KEY>"
`

Use the Ajax Spider if you have applications which heavily depend on Ajax or JavaScript. The Ajax
Spider allows you to crawl web applications written in Ajax in far more depth than the traditional
Spider.You should also use the traditional Spider as well for complete coverage of a application
(e.g. to cover HTML comments).

### Start Ajax Spider

The scan API starts the Ajax Spider based on a given URL. Similar to the Traditional Spider, Ajax
Spider can be also limited to a context or scope. The parameter 'contextName' can be used to
constrain the scan to a Context, the option 'inScope' is ignored if a context was also specified.
The parameter 'subtreeOnly' allows to restrict the spider under a site's subtree (using the
specified 'URL').

### View Status

Unlike the traditional Spider, Ajax Spider does not provide a percentage for the work to be done.
Use the [status][50] endpoint to identify whether the Ajax Spider is still active or finished.

### View Results

Similar to the Traditional Spider, the Ajax Spider's [results][51] API can be used to view the
resources which are crawled by the Ajax Spider. The following image shows a sample response given by
the API.

[ajax_spider_results]

### Stop the Ajax Spider

Ajax spider does not have an indication on how much resources are left to be crawled. Therefore if
the Ajax spider takes too much time than expected, then it can be stopped by using the [stop][52]
API.

View the [advanced section on Ajax Spider][53] to learn more about how to further fine-tune the
results of the Ajax Spider.

Well done! Now ZAP has crawled the application using the Spider or the Ajax Spider. Move on to the
attacking section to learn how to find vulnerabilities using the identified resources.

# Attacking the App

The application should be explored before starting to scan for security vulnerabilities. If you
haven't done that look at the [explore][54] section on how to explore the web application. The
following section provides examples on how to use the Passive and Active Scanner to find security
vulnerabilities in the application.

In many jurisdictions it is illegal to "test" web sites/applications without permission. Please be
aware that you should only use ZAP with targets that you have been specifically given permission to
test.

## Using Passive Scan

`public class PassiveScan {

    private static final int ZAP_PORT = 8080;
    private static final String ZAP_API_KEY = null;
    private static final String ZAP_ADDRESS = "localhost";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClientApi api = new ClientApi(ZAP_ADDRESS, ZAP_PORT, ZAP_API_KEY);
        int numberOfRecords;

        try {
            // TODO : explore the app (Spider, etc) before using the Passive Scan API, Refer the exp
lore section for details
            // Loop until the passive scan has finished
            while (true) {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
                api.pscan.recordsToScan();
                numberOfRecords = Integer.parseInt(((ApiResponseElement) api.pscan.recordsToScan()).
getValue());
                System.out.println("Number of records left for scanning : " + numberOfRecords);
                if (numberOfRecords == 0) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            System.out.println("Passive Scan completed");

            // Print Passive scan results/alerts
            System.out.println("Alerts:");
            System.out.println(new String(api.core.xmlreport(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Exception : " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
`
`#!/usr/bin/env python

=0&count=10"
`

All requests that are proxied through ZAP or initialised by tools like the Spider are passively
scanned. You do not have to manually start the passive scan process, ZAP by default passively scans
all HTTP and WebSocket messages (requests and responses)
which are sent to the application.

Passive scanning does not change the requests nor the responses in any way and is therefore safe to
use. This is good for finding problems like missing security headers or missing anti CSRF tokens but
is no good for finding vulnerabilities like XSS which require malicious requests to be sent - that's
the job of the [active scanner][55].

As the records are passively scanned it will take additional time to complete the full scan. After
the crawling is completed use the [recordsToScan][56] API to obtain the number of records left to be
scanned. After the scanning has completed the alerts can be obtained via the alerts endpoint(s).

View the [advanced section][57] to know how to configure additional parameters of Passive Scan.

## Using Active Scan

Active scanning attempts to find potential vulnerabilities by using known attacks against the
selected targets. Active scanning is an attack on those targets. You should **NOT** use it on
applications that you do not have permission to.

### Start Active Scanner

`public class ActiveScan {

    private static final int ZAP_PORT = 8080;
    private static final String ZAP_API_KEY = null;
    private static final String ZAP_ADDRESS = "localhost";
    private static final String TARGET = "https://public-firing-range.appspot.com";

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ClientApi api = new ClientApi(ZAP_ADDRESS, ZAP_PORT, ZAP_API_KEY);

        try {
            // TODO : explore the app (Spider, etc) before using the Active Scan API, Refer the expl
ore section
            System.out.println("Active Scanning target : " + TARGET);
            ApiResponse resp = api.ascan.scan(TARGET, "True", "False", null, null, null);
            String scanid;
            int progress;

            // The scan now returns a scan id to support concurrent scanning
            scanid = ((ApiResponseElement) resp).getValue();
            // Poll the status until it completes
            while (true) {
                Thread.sleep(5000);
                progress =
                        Integer.parseInt(
                                ((ApiResponseElement) api.ascan.status(scanid)).getValue());
                System.out.println("Active Scan progress : " + progress + "%");
                if (progress >= 100) {
                    break;
                }
            }

            System.out.println("Active Scan complete");
            // Print vulnerabilities found by the scanning
            System.out.println("Alerts:");
            System.out.println(new String(api.core.xmlreport(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

        } catch (Exception e) {

The [scan][58] endpoint runs the active scanner against the given URL or Context. Optionally, the
'recurse' parameter can be used to scan URLs under the given URL, the parameter 'inScopeOnly' can be
used to constrain the scan to URLs that are in scope (ignored if a Context is specified). The
parameter 'scanPolicyName' allows to specify the scan policy (if none is given it uses the default
scan policy). The parameters 'method' and 'postData' allow to select a given request in conjunction
with the given URL.

View advanced settings to learn, how to configure the [context][59], [scope][60], and scan policy
with ZAP APIs.

### View Status

The [status][61] API provides the percentage of scanning done by the active scanner. The scan ID
returned via starting the Active Scan should be used to query the status of the scanner.

### View Results

Similar to the passive scan results, the active scan results can be viewed using the same alerts
endpoint(s). The alerts endpoint(s) will show the consolidated results of Passive and Active Scan.

### Stop Active Scanning

Use the [stop][62] API to stop a long running active scan. Optionally you can use the
[stopAllScans][63] endpoints or [pause][64] endpoint to stop and pause the active scanning.

It should be noted that active scanning can only find certain types of vulnerabilities. Logical
vulnerabilities, such as broken access control, will not be found by any active or automated
vulnerability scanning. Manual penetration testing should always be performed in addition to active
scanning to find all types of vulnerabilities.

`

After the scanning (Active/Passive) completes, ZAP provides the security vulnerabilities in the form
of alerts. The alerts are categorized into high-priority, medium-priority, low-priority and
informational priority risks. The priority indicates the degree of risk associated with each alert.
For example, a high priority risk means that the issues listed in that category has more threat or
risk potential than a medium-priority alert.

The [alerts][65] endpoint provides all the alerts which are identified by ZAP. View the sample code
on the right to retrieve the alerts from the alerts endpoint. The results can be used to raise
security alerts in the CI/CD pipeline or to trigger any custom workflows.

[alert_sample]

The [alerts summary][66] gets the number of alerts grouped by each risk level and optionally
filtering by URL. A Summary report can be also generated using the core module. Use the
[htmlreport][67] or [jsonreport][68] or [xmlreport][69] endpoint to generate this summary report.
The following image shows the report generated via the HTML report API. The report categories the
alerts to risk level and provides a brief description about each alert.

# Getting Authenticated

The target application for testing might have a portion of the functionality that is only available
for a logged-in user. In order to get full test coverage of the application you need to test the
application with a logged-in user as well. Therefore it's very important to understand how to
perform authenticated scans with ZAP. ZAP has several means to authenticate your application and
keep track of the authentication state. The following are some of the options available for
authentication with ZAP.

* Form-based authentication
* Script-based authentication
* JSON-based authentication
* HTTP/NTLM based authentication

The examples below show three authentication workflows. A simple form-based authentication is
showcased with the use of the Bodgeit application. The second example shows the script-based
authentication using the Damn Vulnerable Web Application(DVWA). The third example shows a more
complicated authentication workflow using the JSON and script-based authentication using the OWASP
Juice Shop.

It's recommended to configure the authentication using the desktop UI before automating it using the
ZAP APIs. The examples below show how to configure authentication with ZAP desktop and provides
automation scripts on how to perform the similar using ZAP APIs.

## General Steps

The following are the general steps when configuring the application authentication with ZAP.

**Step 1. Define a context**

Contexts are a way of relating a set of URLs together. The URLs are defined as a set of regular
expressions (regex). You should include the target application inside the context. The unwanted URLs
such as the logout page, password change functionality should be added to the exclude in context
section.

**Step 2. Set the authentication mechanism**

Choose the appropriate login mechanism for your application. If your application supports a simple
form-based login, then choose the form-based authentication method. For complex login workflows, you
can use the script-based login to define custom authentication workflows.

**Step 3. Define your auth parameters**

In general, you need to provide the settings on how to communicate to the authentication service of
your application. In general, the settings would include the login URL and payload format (username
& password). The required parameters will be different for different authentication methods.

**Step 4. Set relevant logged in/out indicators**

ZAP additionally needs hints to identify whether the application is authenticated or not. To verify
the authentication status, ZAP supports logged in/out regexes. These are regex patterns that you
should configure to match strings in the responses which indicate if the user is logged in or logged
out.

**Step 5. Add a valid user and password**

Add a user account (an existing user in your application) with valid credentials in ZAP. You can
create multiple users if your application exposes different functionality based on user roles.
Additionally, you should also set valid session management when configuring the authentication for
your application. Currently, ZAP supports cookie-based session management and HTTP authentication
based session management.

**Step 6. Enable forced user mode (Optional)**

Now enable the "[Forced User Mode disabled - click to enable][70]" button. Pressing this button will
cause ZAP to resend the authentication request whenever it detects that the user is no longer logged
in, ie by using the 'logged in' or 'logged out' indicator. But the forced user mode is ignored for
scans that already have a user set.

In order for auth to work one of the indicators(logged in/out) needs to be set, however, ZAP will
allow users to proceed without having to set them because there are other methods of setting them.
However, if one isn't set, then the auth won't work.

`

The following example performs a simple [form-based authentication][73] using the Bodgeit vulnerable
application. It's recommended that you configure the authentication via the desktop UI before
attempting the APIs.

### Setup Target Application

Bodgeit uses a simple form-based authentication to authenticate the users to the application. Use
the following command to start a docker instance of the Bodgeit application: `docker run --rm -p
8090:8080 -i -t psiinon/bodgeit`

### Register a User

Register a user in the application by navigating to the following URL:
[http://localhost:8090/bodgeit/register.jsp][74]. For the purpose of this example, use the following
credentials.

* username: [[email protected]][75]
* password: weakPass

### Login

After registering the user, browse (proxied via ZAP) to the following URL
([http://localhost:8090/bodgeit/login.jsp][76]), and log in to the application. When you log in to
the application, the request will be added to the `History` tab in ZAP. Search for the POST request
to the following URL: [http://localhost:8090/bodgeit/login.jsp][77]. Right-click on the post
request, and select `Flag as Context -> Default Context : Form based Login Request` option. This
will open the context authentication editor. You can notice it has auto-selected the form-based
authentication, auto-filled the login URL, and the post data. Select the correct form parameter as
the username and password in the dropdown and click Ok.

Now you need to inform ZAP whether the application is logged in or out. The Bodgeit application
includes the logout URL `<a href="logout.jsp">Logout</a>` as the successful response. You can view
this by navigating to the response tab of the login request. Highlight the text and right click and
select the `Flag as Context -> Default Context, Loggedin Indicator` option. This will autofill the
regex needed for the login indicator. The following image shows the completed set up for the
authentication tab of the context menu.

[auth]

Now let's add the user credentials by going to the `context -> users -> Add` section. After adding
the credentials, enable the "[Forced User][78]" mode in the desktop UI to forcefully authenticate
the user prior to the testing of the application.

Now let's test the authentication by performing an authenticated Spidering with ZAP. To accomplish
this, go to the Spider and select the `default` context and the `test user` to perform the
authentication. After this, you should see the Spider crawling all the protected resources.

It's not mandatory to set the forced user mode, if you manually set a user for ZAP activities such
as scanning.

### Steps to Reproduce via API

If you have configured the authentication via the desktop UI, then export the context and import it
using the [importContext][79] API. Otherwise follow the steps below to configure the authentication
setting for the context.

#### Include in Context

In order to proceed with authentication, the URL of the application should be added to the context.
As Bodgeit is available via [http://localhost:8090/bodgeit][80] use the [includeInContext][81] API
to add the URL to a context.

#### Set Authentication Method

Use the [setAuthenticationMethod][82] to set up the authentication method and the configuration
parameters. The `setAuthenticationMethod` takes `contextId`, `authMethodName`, and
`authMethodConfigParams` as parameters. As Bodgeit uses the form-based authentication, use
`formBasedAuthentication` for the authMethodName and use the contextID from Step 1 as the
`contextId` parameter.

The authMethodConfigParams requires the loginUrl and loginRequestData. Therefore you should set the
values to authMethodConfigParams in the following format:

`authMethodConfigParams :
loginUrl=http://localhost:8090/bodgeit/login.jsp&loginRequestData=username%3D%7B%25username%25%7D%26
password%3D%7B%25password%25%7D`

The values for authMethodConfigParams parameters must be URL encoded, in this case loginRequestData
is `username={%username%}&password={%password%}`.

#### Set Login and Logout Indicators

Use the [setLoggedOutIndicator][83] to set the logout indicators of the application. The Following
is the regex command to match the successful response with the Bodgeit application. `\Q<a
href=\"logout.jsp\"></a>\E`

#### Create User and Enable Forced User Mode

Now add the user credentials via the [setAuthenticationCredentials][84] API and use the
[SetForcedUserModeEnabled][85] to enable the forced user mode in ZAP.

ZAP has scripting support for most of the popular languages. The following are some of the scripting
languages supported by ZAP.

* JavaScript
* Python
* Ruby
* Groovy
* Zest

ZAP has an Add-on Marketplace where you can get add-ons for additional scripting engines. Click the
red, blue, & green box stacked icon in ZAP to bring up the marketplace modal. After it pops up,
switch to the Marketplace and install the appropriate scripting engine.

The following example performs a script based authentication for the Damn Vulnerable Web
Application. Similar to the Bodgeit example DVWA also uses `POST` request to authenticate the users.
But apart from username and password DVWA sends an additional token to protect against the
Cross-Site request forgery attacks. This token is obtained from the landing page. The following
image shows the embedded token in the login page.

The newer ZAP versions support anti-CSRF tokens with the form-based authentication. The example
provided below shows how the script-based authentication method can be used to perform custom
workflows in ZAP.

[csrf_token]

If the token is not included with the login script as a POST parameter, the request will be
rejected. In order to send this token, lets use the script based authentication technique. The
authentication script will parse the HTML content and extract the token and append it in the POST
request.

### Setup Target Application

Use the following docker command to start the DVWA. In order to fully complete the setup you need to
login ([http://localhost:3000][86]) to the application and press the configure button. Use the
default credentials of the application to login and finish the setup (Username: admin, Password:
password).

`docker run --rm -it -p 3000:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa`

### Create the Script

Go to the Scripts tab and create a new Authentication script. Provide a name to the script and
select `JavaScript/Nashorn` as the engine and replace the script contents with the following
[script][87].

[script_tab]

### Configure Context Authentication

Now navigate to [http://localhost:3000][88] and add the URL to the default context. Then double
click on the default context and select the script-based authentication as the authentication
method. Now load the script from the drop down provided and the following parameter values.

* Login URL: `http://localhost:3000/login.php`
* CSRF Field: `user_token`
* POST Data: `username={%username%}&password={%password%}&Login=Login&user_token={%user_token%}`
* Logged in regex: `\Q<a href="logout.php">Logout</a>\E`
* Logged out regex: `(?:Location: [./]*login\.php)|(?:\Q<form action="login.php" method="post">\E)`

[context_auth]

Now add the default admin user to the users tab and enable the user.

* User Name: `Administrator`
* Username: `admin`
* Password: `password`

As the login operation is performed by the script lets add the login URL as out of context.
Additionally you should add pages which will disrupt the login process to out of context. For
example, by not excluding the logout URL, the Spider will trigger unwanted logouts (ex.:
logoff/password change, etc.). Therefore, add the following regex(s) to the "Exclude from Context"
tab.

* `\Qhttp://localhost:3000/login.php\E`
* `\Qhttp://localhost:3000/logout.php\E`
* `\Qhttp://localhost:3000/setup.php\E`
* `\Qhttp://localhost:3000/security.php\E`

Now you can enable the forced user mode and start the Spider or manually select the admin user for
the Spider scan. If you have selected the forced user mode and also manually selected a user; then
the manually selected user/context will supersede the forced user mode. After this you should see
the Spider crawling all the protected resources. The authentication results will be available
through the Output panel and you can also select the login POST request in the History tab to verify
the token has been sent to the application.

It's not mandatory to set the forced user mode, if you manually set a user for ZAP activities such
as scanning.

### Steps to Reproduce via API

Use the scripts endpoint to upload the script file. Thereafter the configurations are very similar
to the form based authentication with the Bodgeit application. Use the [includeInContext][89] API to
add the URL to the default context and use the [setAuthenticationMethod][90] to setup the
authentication method and the configuration parameters. Finally use the users API to create the
admin user. Refer the script in the right column on how to use the above APIs.

The following example performs a script based authentication for the OWASP Juice Shop. Juice Shop is
a modern application and it contrary to the previous examples the protected resources are accessed
by sending an authorization header(JSON web token).

### Setup Target Application

Use the following docker command to start the OWASP Juice Shop.

`docker run -d -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop`

### Register User

Register a user in the application by navigating to the following URL:
[http://localhost:3000/#/register][93]. For the purpose of this example, use the following
information.

* Email: [[email protected]][94]
* Password: testtest
* Security Question: Select Your eldest siblings middle name (enter any text)

### Login

After registering the user, browse (proxied via ZAP) to the following URL
([http://localhost:3000/#/login][95]) and login to the application. When you login to the
application the request will be added to the `History` tab in ZAP. Search for the POST request to
the following URL: [http://localhost:3000/rest/user/login][96]. Right-click on the POST request, and
select `Flag as Context -> Default Context : JSON-based Auth Login Request` option. This will open
the context authentication editor. You can notice it has auto selected the JSON-based
authentication, auto-filled the login URL and the post data. Select the correct JSON attribute as
the username and password in the dropdown and click Ok. The following image shows the completed
setup for the authentication tab of the context menu.

[json based authentication]

Exit the context editor and go back to the login request. You will notice in the login response
headers there is no set cookie. In the response body you will find the response data.

The request that follows is GET http://localhost:3000/rest/user/whoami which you will notice has a
header called Authorization which uses the token from the response body of the login request. In
body of the response, you should see some info about your user: `{"user":{"id":1,"email":"[[email
protected]][97]"}}`. If you visit that url directly, with your browser, the content of the page is
`{"user":{}}` - the Authorization header is not added to request and it is not authenticated.

This request is initiated as a client side AJAX request using a spec called JWT. Currently ZAP
doesn't have a notion of the Authorization header for sessions so this is where ZAPs scripting
engine will come into play! With ZAP's scripting engine, we can easily add to or augment it's
functionality.

### Add the Script

Now in the left sidebar next to the Sites click + to add Scripts. This will bring into focus in the
sidebar. Drill into `Scripting > Scripts > HTTP Sender`. Then right click on the HTTP Sender and
with that context menu click New Script. Name the script `jwtScript.js` and set the Script Engine to
ECMAScript (do not check the box that says enable).

[json authentication script]

Now that we have that script setup, let's test it out! Go ahead and visit the login page
http://localhost:3000/#/login with the browser launched with ZAP and use your test account to login.
After you login, back in ZAP in the Script Console tab you should see a message that says `Capturing
token for JWT`.

Now visit http://localhost:3000/rest/user/whoami directly in the browser and you will see you get
JSON data with the user `{"user":{"id":9,"email":"[[email protected]][98]"}}`! Back in the Script
Console you will see the script went ahead and added the header!

Now that we have a script ensuring we have the right headers & cookies for authentication, let's go
ahead and try spidering the application again! So let's use the same settings we used earlier from
the AJAX Spider [Settings][99]. Once the scan starts, check out the browser running the scan -
you'll notice the user is logged in! (Logout & Your Basket links visible). Now the AJAX Spider will
pick up some new paths that it couldn't find before!

### Steps to Reproduce via API

Use the scripts endpoint to add the script file. Thereafter the configurations are very similar to
the form based authentication with the Bodgeit application. Use the [includeInContext][100] API to
add the URL to the default context
and use the [setAuthenticationMethod][101] to setup the authentication method and the configuration
parameters. Finally use the users API to create the admin user. Refer the script in the right column
on how to use the above APIs.

# Advanced Settings

The following section shows advanced configurations of the APIs.

## Spider Settings

The following image shows the advanced configurations tab of Spider in the desktop UI.

[spider_advanced]

Use the [setOptionMaxDepth][102] API to set the maximum depth the spider can crawl, where 0 refers
to unlimited depth. The [setOptionMaxChildren][103] API sets the maximum number of child nodes (per
node) that can be crawled, where 0 means no limit. The [setOptionMaxDuration][104] API can be used
to set the maximum duration the Spider will run. Use the [setOptionMaxParseSizeBytes][105] API to
limit the amount of data parsed by the spider. This allows the spider to skip big responses/files.

View the [Spider section][106] in the API Catalogue for additional APIs.

## Ajax Spider Settings

The following image shows the advanced configurations tab of Ajax Spider in the desktop UI.

[ajax_spider_advanced]

Similar to the Spider API, the Ajax spider also provides APIs to set the [maximum depth][107],
[crawl state][108], and [maximum duration][109].

## Passive Scan Settings

The scanning rules can be enabled/disabled using the [enableScanners][110] and
[disableScanners][111] APIs. Also use the [setScanOnlyInScope][112] API to limit the passive
scanning to a scope. View the advanced section to learn how to configure a context or scope using
ZAP APIs.

Passive scanning can also be used to automatically add tags and raise alerts for potential issues. A
set of rules for automatic tagging are provided by default. These can be changed, deleted or added
to via the Options Passive Scan Tags Screen.

## Active Scan Settings

### General Options

The general options for Active Scan can be configured using the options tab in the desktop UI shown
below.

[options]

Use the [setOptionMaxScanDurationInMins][113] API to limit the duration of scan and
[setOptionMaxRuleDurationInMins][114] API to limit the time of individual active scan rules. This
can be used to prevent rules from running for an excessive amount of time.

Use the [setOptionHostPerScan][115] API to set the maximum number of hosts that will be scanned at
the same time. Furthermore, use the [setOptionThreadPerHost][116] API to set the number of threads
the scanner will use per host. Increasing both of these values will reduce the active scanning time
but this may put extra strain on the server ZAP is running on.

Use the [setOptionDelayInMs][117] API to delay each request from ZAP in milliseconds. Setting this
to a non zero value will increase the time an active scan takes, but will put less of a strain on
the target host. View the [Active Scan][118] section in the API Catalogue for additional information
regarding the APIs.

### Input Vectors

Input vectors refers to the elements that Active Scan will target. Specifying the exact elements to
target will improve the scanning time and accuracy of the results. For example, for the following
configuration the [optionTargetParamsInjectable][119] and [optionTargetParamsEnabledRPC][120] will
yield the results of 11 and 39. The numbers can be deconstructed in the following manner:

* 1+2+8 = 11 [Query String(1), Post Data(2), HTTP Headers(8)]
* 1+2+4+32 = 39 [Multipart (1), XML (2), JSON (4), DWR (32)]

[input_vectors_code]

Thus, to change the values of `Injectable targets` and `Input Vector Handlers` calculate the exact
values and use the [setoptiontargetparamsinjectable][121] and [setoptiontargetparamsenabledrpc][122]
APIs accordingly.

The `Add URL query parameter` option under the `Injectable Tragets` sets whether or not the active
scanner should add a query param to GET requests which do not have parameters to start with. This
option can be enabled using the [setoptionaddqueryparam][123] API.

### Technology

[technology]

The Technology tab allows you to specify which types of technologies to scan. Un-selecting
technologies that you know are not present in the target application may speed up the scan, as rules
which target that technology can skip those tests. For an example, if the target web application
does not have a database then removing it will increase the performance of the Active Scan.

Use the [includeContextTechnologies][124] and [excludeContextTechnologies][125] API endpoints to
include and exclude the technology list from the context.

### Policy

A scan policy defines exactly which rules are run as part of an active scan. It also defines how
these rules run influencing how many requests are made and how likely potential issues are to be
flagged. You can define as many scan policies as you like and select the most appropriate one when
you start the scan via the Active Scan.

[policy]

The Policy tab shown in the above image allows you to override any of the settings specified in the
selected scan policy.

# Contributions Welcome!

Contributions are welcome! There are many ways you can contribute to ZAP, both as a user and as a
developer.

**1. Creating High-level API/Automation Docs**

Create high level docs or example guides on how to use the APIs to perform any action/view with ZAP.
The source files for the ZAP API documentation is hosted on GitHub. The repository is available at
[Github][126]. The source files are in `Markdown` (md) format.

**2. REST API Documentation**

ZAP's rest API is documented using the OpenAPI specification. The specification could be improved by
enhancing the description of parameters/ results/ data types etc. The open API specification is
available via [GitHub][127].

**3. Feature Documentation**

Feature documentation related to ZAP is available on [ZAP wiki][128], [ZAP user guide][129], and
[ZAP extensions][130] repositories.

## How to Contribute

The ZAP API documentation is developed according to the [docs as code][131] philosophy. The most
direct and effective way to contribute to the docs is to submit a pull request(PR) or raise an issue
in the GitHub repository containing the docs content that you want to change.

There are 2 different workflows which you can use to make changes or PRs. Use what you are most
comfortable with!

**1. "Edit this File on GitHub"**

You can edit the documentation in the browser via navigating to the relevant source file and
clicking the edit this file button. This workflow is recommended for minor changes. For example
correcting typos/spellings/grammar etc. For extensive changes, please use the local setup and
editing option.

**2. Local Setup and Editing**

You can fork the repository on GitHub and submit the changes via [pull requests][132]. Please see
the local setup for API docs section to setup and render the docs locally.

The API documentation (this document) is built from the default branch of zap-api-docs using Slate.

## Local Setup for API Docs

ZAP uses git for its code repository. To submit a documentation update, use the following steps:

**1. Clone the ZAP Docs repository:** `git clone https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-api-docs`

**2. Navigate to the cloned repository:** `cd zap-api-docs`

**3. Use the following guide to install [Ruby][133]**

**4. To install the dependencies:** `$ bundle install`

**5. To start the server:** `$ bundle exec middleman server`

## Documentation Style

This style guide provides a set of editorial guidelines for anyone writing documentation for ZAP.

### General Guidelines

* Check for the grammar and spellings before sending the pull request. Most of the modern editors
  comes with a spell check option or plugin.
* Use a friendly and conversational tone. Always use simple sentences. If the sentence is lengthy
  try to break it in to smaller sentences. Also avoid sentences with complicated words or jargon.
* Write positively and avoid using negative sentences.
  
  * Recommended: If you are not familiar with the Spider, then read this documentation.
  * Not Recommended: Read this documentation to get familiarized with the Spider.
* The documentation should be neutral, without judgments, opinions. For example, words like "easily"
  or "simple" come with a lot of assumptions. Things that are easier for you might be difficult for
  another person. Avoid this type of wordings when contributing to the document.

### Language and Grammar

* Abbreviation
  
  Spell out the abbreviation or acronym before introducing them in the sentence. If the abbreviation
  is well known such as API or ZAP or HTML, you can use it without spelling it first.
* Active Voice
  
  In general use active voice when formulating the sentence instead of passive voice. A sentence
  written in the active voice will emphasize the person or thing who is performing an action (eg.The
  dog chased the ball). In contrast, the passive voice will highlight the recipient of the action
  (The ball was chased by the dog). Therefor use the passive voice, only when it's less important
  who or what completed the action and more important that the action was completed. For example:
  
  * Recommended: The Spider crawls the URLs.
  * Not recommended: The URLs are crawled by the Spider.
* Gender References
  
  Use gender neutral pronouns (they/their/them) when referring to a hypothetical person such as "a
  user with a logged in session". For example, instead of: - he or she, use they; - him or her, use
  them; - his or her, use their; - his or hers, use theirs; - himself or herself, use themselves;
* Method Description
  
  When you're writing reference documentation for a method, phrase the main method description in
  terms of what it does ("Gets," "Starts," "Creates," "Lists"), rather than what the developer would
  use it to do ("Get," "Start," "Create," "List").
  
  * Recommended: action.scan: Starts the Spider on the specified URL.
  * Not recommended: action.scan: Start the Spider on the specified URL.
* Second Person
  
  In general, use second person in your docs rather than first person. For example:
  
  * Recommended: You are recommended to use the Spider.
  * Not Recommended: We recommend to use the Spider.
* Spellings
  
  Use [American spellings][134] when contributing to the documentation.

### Formatting

* Capitalization:
  
  * Use the Chicago manual for capitalization rules for the documentation.
  * For titles of a section, Capitalize of the first letter of each word except for the
    [closed-class words][135] such as determiners, pronouns, conjunctions, and prepositions. Use the
    following [link][136] for guidance.
    
    * Recommended: The Spider Tutorial **with** APIs
  * For normal sentences don't [capitalize][137] random words in the middle of the sentences.
* Number formatting
  
  * In general spell out the number if it starts a sentence or is less than ten or an ordinal
    number.
    
    * Recommended: Seventeen requests has been intercepted by the passive scanner.
    * Recommended: The passive scan showed nine warnings.
    * Recommended: The fifth alert was a high priority alert.
  * Use numerals for numbers higher than ten or fractions or unit prices.
    
    * Recommended: The active scanner detected 24 issues.
    * Recommended: The scanner took 23.4 seconds to complete the crawling.

### Punctuation

* Commas
  
  * Use oxford commas when writing a list of three or more items
    
    * Recommended: The API can return the results in XML, JSON, and HTML.
    * Not Recommended: The API can return the results in XML, JSON and HTML.
* Periods
  
  * Do not add period to headings or titles.
  * Avoid using periods at the end of URLs. Try to modify the sentence so the URL can be in the
    middle of the sentence.

## Markdown Syntax

The API docs are created using standard markdown files. This section contains information regarding
the syntax and linting of the Markdown files. Refer to the [Slate documentation][138]. Also refer to
this [document][139] to properly lint the Markdown files.

### Writing Code

**Inline Code**

Put ``backticks`` around the following symbols when used in text:

* Data types: `json`, `xml`, `html`
* File name: `test.py`, `/path-to-your-data/xml/example-name`

**Code Block**

Use three back ticks to open and close a code block. Specify the programming language after the
first backtick group. The documentation currently supports `python`, `java`, and `shell` languages.

[code_example]

# Troubleshooting

This section explains how to troubleshoot issues that might occur when interacting with the ZAP API.

## Enable Useful Dev Options

While developing scripts/programs that interact with ZAP API it's recommended that the following
[ZAP API options][140] are enabled, to have more information about possible errors:

* `Report permission errors via API`
* `Report error details via API`

The API response will then contain the details about why the API request was rejected or was not
successful.

The ZAP log/output will always provide these details if you are not able to enable those options,
e.g. not developing in a safe environment.

## Common Errors

### Wrong API Key or Address Not Allowed

`//org.zaproxy.clientapi.core.ClientApiException: java.net.SocketException: Unexpected end of file f
rom server
//  at org.zaproxy.clientapi.core.ClientApi.callApiDom(ClientApi.java:366)
//  at org.zaproxy.clientapi.core.ClientApi.callApi(ClientApi.java:350)
//  at org.zaproxy.clientapi.gen.Spider.scan(Spider.java:242)
`
`requests.exceptions.ProxyError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='127.0.0.1', port=8080): Max retries exceed
ed with 
url: http://zap/JSON/spider/action/scan/?apikey=changeMe&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com 
(Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection w
ithout response')))
`

By default, ZAP will close the connection without a response if an API request is not from an
allowed address or the API key is wrong. If you get exceptions similar to the following ensure that
the API client is using the correct API key and that the address is allowed.

### No Connection to ZAP

`//org.zaproxy.clientapi.core.ClientApiException: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: con
nect
//  at org.zaproxy.clientapi.core.ClientApi.callApiDom(ClientApi.java:366)
//  at org.zaproxy.clientapi.core.ClientApi.callApi(ClientApi.java:350)
//  at org.zaproxy.clientapi.gen.Spider.scan(Spider.java:242)
//  at ZAP_tests.Spider.main(Spider.java:25)
`
`requests.exceptions.ProxyError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='127.0.0.1', port=8080): Max retries exceed
ed with 
url: http://zap/JSON/spider/action/scan/?apikey=changeMe&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com 
(Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnec
tion object at 
0x101be78e0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 61] Connection refused')))
`

There are several reasons that the API client might not be able to connect to ZAP:

* ZAP is not yet started, some clients might have methods to wait for ZAP;
* ZAP is not listening on the address, for example, if the API client is connecting from an external
  machine then ZAP will have to listen on the external address (or all addresses `0.0.0.0`)
* The API client is not configured with correct address/port;

### Error: No Implementor

If you come across the `No Implementor Error` while invoking the APIs: Check the necessary add-on or
component is installed and enabled. (For example if you receive "no_implementor" in relation to Ajax
Spider calls, perhaps the Ajax Spider add-on isn't installed.)

`GET /JSON/spider/action/scan/`

Runs the spider against the given URL (or context). Optionally, the 'maxChildren' parameter can be
set to limit the number of children scanned, the 'recurse' parameter can be used to prevent the
spider from seeding recursively, the parameter 'contextName' can be used to constrain the scan to a
Context and the parameter 'subtreeOnly' allows to restrict the spider under a site's subtree (using
the specified 'url').
