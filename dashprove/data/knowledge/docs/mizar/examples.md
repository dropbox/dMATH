# Mizar Mathematical Library

The Mizar Mathematical Library (MML) consists of [*Mizar Articles*][1]. Two articles form the
foundation of the library:

* [built-in notions][2]
* [ the axioms of the Tarski-Grothendieck set theory][3].
All other texts undergo verification by Mizar to be correct consequences of those axioms. The [Mizar
system][4] assists the author of a new text in preparing available terminology and results, verifies
the claims of the text and extracts facts and definitions for inclusion into the library. The task
of building a rich mathematical library is currently the main effort of the Mizar community. Most of
the library texts formalize the fundamentals of introductory mathematics. Some of the texts
contribute more advanced results.
