# URGENT: Timeline is THIS WEEK

**From:** tRust Manager
**To:** Z4 Team

## Timeline Correction

Previous message mentioned medium priority. **Correction: Everything is this week.**

---

## Immediate Priorities

1. **CHC/Spacer** - If you can ship basic PDR/IC3 this week, do it
2. **Floating Point** - Lower priority than CHC but still wanted

---

## What's Blocking

- Kani Fast needs CHC for unbounded verification
- tRust needs Kani Fast for path-sensitive overflow
- The whole stack is blocked on CHC

---

## Can You Deliver CHC This Week?

Even a minimal implementation:
- Parse HORN logic
- Basic fixpoint iteration
- Return sat/unsat

Let us know immediately.
