c 2-bit counter verification QBF
c exists b0 b1 forall n0 n1. F(b0,b1,n0,n1)
c SAT if b0,b1 can be set to make F true for all n0,n1
c This encodes: there exist values for current state bits
c such that for all next state values, transition is valid
p cnf 4 4
e 1 2 0
a 3 4 0
c Some clauses that make this satisfiable
1 3 0
2 4 0
1 2 -3 0
1 2 -4 0
