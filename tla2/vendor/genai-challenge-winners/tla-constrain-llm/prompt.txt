Output a short TLA+ specification of the poker game Texas Hold'em. The specification should concern itself only with the order of play and various actions players can take (match, raise, fold), and should avoid modeling complicated logic about scoring or keeping track of chips. Anything too complicated (for example, which player wins a hand) should be represented by a nondeterministic step.

Subject your output to these constraints:
 - Only output the specification, not any other text or markup
 - Do not put any comments in the spec
 - Do not put any THEOREM constructs in the spec

Some help with TLA+:
 - The canonical top-level spec definition is "Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_v" where "v" is a tuple of variables or the spec's single variable
 - Access to common arithmetic operators like +, -, *, and % requires importing the Naturals or Integers module using EXTENDS
 - Record values are defined using the syntax [fieldName |-> fieldValue] and accessed using r.fieldName
 - Function values are defined using the syntax [x \in domainSet |-> someTransformationOf(x)] and accessed using f[val]
 - Functions and records can be confusing; it is best to avoid them if possible, or make the domainSet expression very small and simple. Avoid extending the domainSet expression with conjunctions.
 - Ternary operators are defined using IF condition THEN ifTrue ELSE ifFalse
 - The spec ends with ==== of length at least 4
 - Spec variables are declared with the "VARIABLES" keyword
 - Spec constants are declared with the "CONSTANTS" keyword
 - Often, the top-level next action is defined using a vertically-aligned disjunction list
 - The next action often refers to preceding actions defined as operators
 - Each individual action often consists of a vertically-aligned conjunction list ensuring all spec variables are constrained to a value in the next state
 - TLA+ definitions must be declared before they are used (i.e. must be declared earlier in the file)
